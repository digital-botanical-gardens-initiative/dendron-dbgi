- The goal of KG Hub is to serve as a collective resource to simplify the process of generating biological and biomedical KGs and thus reducing the barrier for entry to new participants
- In a KG Hub, each independent effort for building a KG is an instance of the KG Hub
- Each KG follows a set of design principles, one of which is the use of Biolink Model as a schema
- Also provides recommendations on set of design patterns to use for building and exchanging KGs
