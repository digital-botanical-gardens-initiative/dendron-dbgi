# This is Edouard's DBGI daily open-notebook.

Today is 2023.01.04

# To do

- Relabel the falcon with the bigger labels

- Try to host correctly the dbgi maps with geoserver

- Prepare the inserts for the mass spec analysis

- Optimize the communication between QGIS and iNaturalist

# done

I found the way to display the map on the website. All is done, the only thing I have still to do is to find a way to host the map. For instance, I can only display the map on my own laptop, because the port is closed. I need to find a way to obtain an old computer and to open ports. But firstly I'll prepare the QGIS map. So the map display on the website is actually suspended.
