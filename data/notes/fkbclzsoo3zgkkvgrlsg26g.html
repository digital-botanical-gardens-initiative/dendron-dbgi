<p> This system works offline, so each time you finish your collection, you need to update the project on the server. To do that, click on the little cloud and click on "push modifications". Wait until all is synced (don't close everything when you are seeing the "finished" text, because pictures are also uploaded, and it takes some time. You will have a notification that is saying that the process is in progress. When the notification disapears, you can close the application). Before each collection, please synce the project to not create syncronization problems. It will take the latest files on the server and store it locally on your phone.</p>
