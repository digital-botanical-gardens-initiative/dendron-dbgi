Perhaps this sampling event https://www.gbif.org/dataset/aea17af8-5578-4b04-b5d3-7adf0c5a1e60/event/a658c0dd-6611-4cf4-b4fe-b1a2d7c4ef65
that resulted in these occurrences https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?dataset_key=aea17af8-5578-4b04-b5d3-7adf0c5a1e60&advanced=1&event_id=a658c0dd-6611-4cf4-b4fe-b1a2d7c4ef65

I found that using the dataset seach and a filter on sampling events.
Here is another entering random string in the eventID filter on occurrence search
https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?advanced=1&event_id=AB%200423%20B1 (and confirmed that the occurrences didn't come from multiple datasets)

Did that help?
