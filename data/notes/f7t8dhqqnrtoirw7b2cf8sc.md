Inaturalist_Commented_Observations table (*Figure 1*) permits to store all iNaturalist observations that have been commented or curated by the community:

- Inat_Id: The iNaturalist identifier of the observation.

- jbuf_taxon: The original taxon proposed by the botanical garden.

- proposed_taxons: If present, the taxon that have been proposed by the iNaturalist community.

- Comments: If present, the comments posted by the iNaturalist community.

- inaturalist_url: The iNaturalist URL of the observation.

This table aims to give a simple and clear interface to check the community curation. It also provides a simple tool to inform botanical gardens of possible errors in labelling. These cases are however very rare. Here you have an example of a community curation: https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/109442139
