## Starting the day

First lets check the last discussions on the forum https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/forum/discussions

### Today's Todo 

- [ ] Testing the lyophilisation technic
- [ ] Prelevating some plants in the botanical garden
- [ ]

### Today Notes & ideas
For the lyophilisation we have tested 15ml tubes, that is a bit small for correctly putting plant parts in it. 50ml would be better. We have tested two different technics to let the vacuum appen in the tube :
- Make little holes in the lid -> Echevaria elegans
- Let a bit open by not completely screw the lid -> Oscularia deltoides, Ephedra helvetica, Leonurus cardiaca, Echevaria elegans

Use of the lyophilisator :
- Turn on the button in the right of the machine
- Precool the machine (10 minutes) with the button on the screen
- Verify that all the circuit is closed (black wheel in the left of the screen and all the taps in the horizontal position)
- Put the sample in the jar and put it in one exit
- Open the tap (bigger part in the bottom)

The prelevated plants (4) of today are the same as the ones harvested by Pierre-Marie Allard 04th april that are the followings :

- https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/110560140

Today afternoon is the meeting with Horst Machguth that is the owner of the drone that we will use to cartography the botanical garden.


## Ending the day

The drone fly is ok, but not already planified. We have to manage with the botanical garden collaborators when we can fly. The lyophilisation has not worked properly, so we have put the samples in the freezer at -80Â°C during the night

### Future Todo

- [ ] Before the meeting with Reynald Delaloye, we have to put again the samples in the lyophilisation machine.
- [ ] Tomorrow morning is the meeting with Reynald Delaloye that permits to use DGPS to georeference the cartography of the botanical garden
- [ ] Find a better way to carry liquid nitrogen in the garden for the plants prelevation
