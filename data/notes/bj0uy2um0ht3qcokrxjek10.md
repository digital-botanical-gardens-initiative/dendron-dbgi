## After adding an observation on QField

When you have successfully added your observation on QField, you need to collect the specimen. Here you can find the protocol on how to do it. If you don't know how to add observations on QField, you can go to this note: [[Bioblitz.Vinesch-Bioblitz.sampling-protocol]].

## Make sure you are ready
- Make sure you have all the necessary material to collect your sample (little cotton bag given during the collection day)
- Make sure you wear gloves (for your security and to avoid sample contaminations) and that you clean it with ethanol after each sample.
- Make sure your observation with the collection application (QField) has been correctly added.

## Collect the specimen

- Take a part of the specimen (if plant, mushroom, big animals) or the whole specimen (for small invertebrates or small plants). Make sure to take the part you defined in the collection application. To do this, you can use a scalpel or a tweezer. Make sure to clean your instrument afterwards to keep it clean for the next sample.

- Put it in the suited container. For small samples, put them first in a coffee filter, then roll it and put it in a prelabelled plastic tube. For bigger samples, you have ziplock plastic bags or paper bags. Be careful, plastic bags break when frozen. If any container is not labelled, ask for a label.

- Done! You have collected your first sample!
