<p>Part of the Knowledge Dissemination aspects of the DBGI include exploring new ways for the publication of research outputs.</p>
<p>One question that we would like to investigate is wether it is possible to publish these outputs as a research consortium.
The idea would be to have a the DBGI consortium as unique author and a contribution table in the article (following <a href="https://credit.niso.org/">CREDIT</a> system or similar) detailing each authors contribution.</p>
<p>This would have several advantages : </p>
<ul>
<li>moving away from the eternal dilemna of determining who should be first / second / third / last (colast !)</li>
<li>a clear identification of the DBGI / EMI initiatives </li>
</ul>
<p>However we need to find the correct way to implement this.
ORCIDs are apparently not made for research groups. </p>
