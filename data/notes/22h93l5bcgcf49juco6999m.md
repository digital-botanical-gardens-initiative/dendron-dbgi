### Talked with Joelle Houriet

Presented the DBGI slides to JoÃ«lle who remarked that oon the slides Lab plants / Botanical Gardens / Wild Ecosystems we are letting aside (or their is no place) for crops and plants cultivated by humans for food purposes (or medicinal purposes also).
We definitively want to include these plants in the Earth Metabolome Initiative so maybe crops should be illustrated in this slide.
