MySQL workbench

Protégé as an Ontop editor for the mappings



Ana find the option that need to be activated on the graphdb enpkg instance so as to allow query form bioquery to work.

to add in graphdb properties

```bash
graphdb.workbench.cors.enable=true
graphdb.workbench.cors.origin=*
```

- Tarcisio will document the Ontop process.
- Share to Tarcisio the whole ENPKG processed data before the graph part.
- PM share table 1. with the parts we want to template
- Ana index individual queries so they have their own URL


- Poke Adriano and Nico to see if we can align on the Swiss part of the KG.
