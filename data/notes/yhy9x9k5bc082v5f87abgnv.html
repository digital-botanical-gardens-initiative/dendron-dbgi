<p>We use <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/home">iNaturalist</a> to track the selected specimens in the DBGI.</p>
<p>See <a href="/dendron-dbgi/notes/ssi87anaiik1o7joqf7mvdp">iNaturalist</a> for some details worked on during Edouard's bachelor.</p>
<p>We had issues to fetch back all observation of a project through <a href="https://github.com/pyinat/pyinaturalist">pyinaturalist</a>, notably because of obscured geolocalisation for some protected species.
This is now solved, see <a href="https://github.com/pyinat/pyinaturalist/issues/403">https://github.com/pyinat/pyinaturalist/issues/403</a>.</p>
<h3 id="we-have-been-wondering-how-to-handle-inaturalist-logins-for-the-collectors">We have been wondering how to handle iNaturalist logins for the collectors<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#we-have-been-wondering-how-to-handle-inaturalist-logins-for-the-collectors"></a></h3>
<p>Currently it is not possible to make an observation shared among observers, despite this beeing a discussed and upvoted topic <a href="https://forum.inaturalist.org/t/share-observations-between-users/337/79">https://forum.inaturalist.org/t/share-observations-between-users/337/79</a></p>
<p>Current situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>We upload all observation with the common <code>dbgi</code> account <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/6687578">https://www.inaturalist.org/people/6687578</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is great because we can fully control observation made in the frame of the dbgi project (eg batch edit or remove them)</p>
<p>We tag each observation with the collector's iNaturalist handle, eg <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/309816396">https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/309816396</a> where the collector is <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/ifedenat25">ifedenat25</a> is tagged
However the observation do not appear in the collector profile.</p>
