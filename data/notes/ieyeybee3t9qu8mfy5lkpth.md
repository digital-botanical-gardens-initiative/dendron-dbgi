[Directus](https://directus.io/) is the nocode interface we use as overlayer of our [[Master-Works.Edouard-Br端lhart.Services.PostgreSQL]] database. It permits to make our database easily available online and to make API requests to it.

We use [[Master-Works.Edouard-Br端lhart.Scripts.directus-db]] script to create both [[Master-Works.Edouard-Br端lhart.Services.PostgreSQL]] and [[Master-Works.Edouard-Br端lhart.Services.Directus]] instances on our laboratory server.
