## Today I learned that

- It is possible to design GitHub actions that run when a file is changed under a specific path. [source](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths).
- If you try to execute a directory by mistake instead of a file, the GitHub actions will raise an oserror 13 permission denied.
