Point on [[EMI.Semantic-model]]

Tarcisio proposed the online protégé 
https://webprotege.stanford.edu/


We have discussed some time (4hours) and I believe, have advanced on the EMI semantic model.
One of the keys here would be to define and emi_system (though part will be defining what it is, but in a nutshell any subpart of the observable universe)
I our case these emi_system would range from the biosphere to an isolated group of analytes. We connect system to other systems through one of the sosa operation (Actuation, Sampling, Observation)
Usually these operation are used to connect system to subsystems. The RO has been discussed to define these relationships.
Now also looking at http://basic-formal-ontology.org/
