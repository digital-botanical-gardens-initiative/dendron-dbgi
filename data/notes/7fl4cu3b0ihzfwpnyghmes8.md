# This is MaÃ«lle's DBGI daily open-notebook.

Today is 2023.02.23


## TODO

- Meeting with pma - 10am
- add dashboard on dbgi github

## CODE

## NOTES

To discuss in meeting:
- molplotly doesn't show the molecules
- dash should be the best
- template for directus


molplotly doesn't show the molecules => problem was in molplotly scripts                    
But still doesn't appear when on a multipage app => issue github



## TODO NEXT

- Run GNPS on local
- issue moltplotly

## Important for redaction

### Important point of my project

(refer to ChordB proposal for details)

1. establish a Dashboard to view "LOTUS type data"

- molecular structures
  - molecular structure metadata 
  - molecular structure taxonomies
- biological organisms
  - biological organisms structure metadata 
  - biological organisms structure taxonomies

This Dashboard can feed on static tabular files

2. establish a Dashboard to view "DBGI type data"

"DBGI type data" = "LOTUS type data" + mass spectrometry data

- LCMS profiles
- spectrums

cf. GNPS LCMS Dashboard

This Dashboard can feed on static tabular files + Mass spec files

3. Improve these Dashboard so they can feed on KG

- SPARQL queries
