> Improve past knowledge exploitation: extract pairs of chemical compound and taxon from literature not present in LOTUS and relevant to the DBGI (papers describing phytochemical investigation of plants of the Swiss Botanical Gardens, e.g. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.112469)

### Examples

Example of a Phytochemistry paper treated by Plazi and SiBILS 
https://sibils.text-analytics.ch/search/?query=Unique%20guanidine-conjugated%20catechins%20from%20the%20leaves%20of%20Alchornea%20rugosa%20and%20their%20autophagy%20modulating%20activity#results-section

Ask Donat and Deborah if they are overlappings papers that would be in BIODIVERSITY PMC ?
Apparently this example is online in MEDLINE and the MEDLINE papers do not seem to benefit from the same treatment within SIBILS. Ask Deborah what are the differences ?



# Enhance future knowledge dissemination

> Enhance future knowledge dissemination: explore publication solutions to efficiently disseminate knowledge acquired from metabolomics, that is, putative occurrences of chemical structures in biological matrices (simple RDF triples, Nanopublications (https://nanopub.org/) or similar).
