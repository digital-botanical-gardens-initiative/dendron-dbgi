<p>The code to change pictures metadata is done and is working. It is available on github: <a href="https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/iNaturalist_uploader">https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/iNaturalist_uploader</a></p>
<p>The code is made to adapt. It signifies that if we create a new project or a new layer, it will be integrated. If a project is created, don't forget to add the dbgi user as manager, because it is the one that is used to download the files.</p>
<p>What the code is doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downloads gpkg layers (point layers) and pictures</li>
<li>Changes pictures names by deleting all problematic symbols and replacing white spaces by underscores</li>
<li>Detects the CRS (Coordinates reference system) of gpkg files and converts to EPSG:4326, that is the CRS used by inat</li>
<li>Converts the gpkg files to csv files</li>
<li>Compresses pictures if they are bigger than 5MB (while loop with little decrease each time, so that the pictures are not compressed to heavily)</li>
<li>Adds coordinates and dbgi code in pictures metadata to facilitate inat import.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now stays some questions to finish the job correclty:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which cloud to use? (already discussed about nextcloud)</li>
<li>Where to host ? (On the field collection server or on another server)</li>
<li>clicbot or not clicbot ? And if clicbot, how to manage it? (As inat won't be happy if they know)</li>
<li>How to organize pictures on the cloud? (one folder per sample with folder named with dbgi code, one folder per layer, one folder per layer per upload, ...)</li>
</ul>
