This is Disha's DBGI daily open-notebook.

 

## Doing
1. #VKG modify TRY-db csv file to include 1 column explaining the data type (one of the folloiwng three values): continuous-trait, discrete-trait, non-trait to distinguish between quuantitative & non-quanititattive trait and non trait data
2. #SciComm In talks with Manuela Dahinden to shape the AGORA grant. Meeting on 17th May with Manuela, Emmanuel and Pierr-Marie.
3. #VKG Transfer all data to UniFr system and test SPARQL queries.
4. Start Intro for the paper.


## Done  
In the last 2 weeks, I did the following:
1. #VKG segregating information into only necessary columns in GLOBI interaction data (92 columns at the moment, not all are useful) and map it to the existing try-db database.
2. #VKG Created all mappings between TRY-db, GloBI and subset of ENPKG, through wikidata ids.
