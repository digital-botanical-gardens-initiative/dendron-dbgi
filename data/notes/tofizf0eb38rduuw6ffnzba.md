Welcome the the DBGI Dendron.

As you might have read in [[root]], we will follow the Open Notebook Science approach to document our research in the frame of the DBGI projects.

For this we use the Dendron system as a mean to efficiently capture notes and publish them.

## What is this note

This note is a succinct tutorial note aiming to get you started in the use of the DBGI Dendron.

## Tutorial

### Dendron. 

#### What is Dendron ?

> Dendron is an open-source, local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool. Think of it as a cache for everything that you care about - if you've spent more then five minutes solving a problem, you should never spent any more time solving the same exact problem.
> 
> Dendron is a knowledge base built by and for developers and integrates natively with IDEs like VS Code and VSCodium.
