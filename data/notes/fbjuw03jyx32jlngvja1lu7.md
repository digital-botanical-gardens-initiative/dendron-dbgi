During this work, we have realised that some processes are not automatized enough. In the future we will try to automatize more the processes, especially the sampling. For this, we have some ideas, like directly link the samples pictures to the QField project. [Here](https://docs.qfield.org/how-to/pictures/) you can see some litterature speaking about the subject.

Another point is the accessiblity of the molecular network. For now, we have to dowload it and open it witha a software (Cytoscape). It would be more convenient to directly display it ont this website.

And, of course, we have to continue the sampling of the Jardin Botanique de l'Universit√© de Fribourg.
