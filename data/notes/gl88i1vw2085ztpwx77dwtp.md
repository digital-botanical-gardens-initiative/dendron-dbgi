As results, we have obtained a molecular network composed of 80 plants of 40 different species (40 samples with silica gel and 40 samples with liquid nitrogen) for more than 9700 features.

## Comparison of the two sample technics

We can see below that a large majority of compounds are conserved across both sampling methods despite some minor differences. After an organisation of the samples based on chemistery ploted with a phylogenetic tree (second image below), we have seen that most species couples are located at the same position of the tree. That indicates a global conservation of the metabolites between the 2 methods.

These results have been obtained by profiling the plants less than one month after the sampling. Therefor, it is not guaranteed that these results are true for older stored samples.

## Analyse of the molecular network

For now, we haven't really observed the chemical features in detail, because hat wasn't the principle goal of this work. It will probably come later on.
