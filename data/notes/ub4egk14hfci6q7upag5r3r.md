## Doing
Bring back up the prototype DBGI Bioquery interface.

This will be hosted here: https://biosoda.unil.ch/bioquery/ 

Some adaptations to the code are required (e.g. new SPARQL endpoint using UNIL VM here: https://biosoda.unil.ch/graphdb)


Also in plan: Bring up a first Bio-SODA prototype over the DBGI data, to be hosted at https://biosoda.unil.ch/dbgi-biosoda/ .
