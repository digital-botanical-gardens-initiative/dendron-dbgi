## NOTES

Problem with JSME object: can't found a way to export the SMILE value.
Tried different ways but seems like I have to use a JS script to get the data and then pass it to python.

Have a look at: https://iwatobipen.wordpress.com/2020/12/30/embed-molecular-editor-into-streamlit-app-streamlit-chemoinformatics-rdkit/

'eventSmiles' argument for dash-bio.jsme? https://github.com/plotly/dash-bio/pull/587/files
