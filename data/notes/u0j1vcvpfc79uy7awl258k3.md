# This is Marco's daily open-notebook.

Today is 2024.01.12


## Notes
### notes on Rust
fuzzer ? --> test modality 


### call with PMA and Luca
#### LOTUS anticipated
##### Why can't I merge a graph with edge weights with an other that has no weights ? 
We can't have one graph with edges and the other not due to data structure. One solution could be to add multiple graph into the model. How ?

* two problems : edge weights can mean different 
* negative edges weights need also a weight
