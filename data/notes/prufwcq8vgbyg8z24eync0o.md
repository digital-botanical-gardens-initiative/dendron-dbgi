> One way I think we could connect with DBGI/EMI and the citizen sciences aspects is via the iNaturalist platform.
> I see that your workshop is on Wikidata (in part) why not explore possibilities to strengthen WD <-> iNat links ? (Not sure this is exactly citizen science though) However it could allow iNat user to fetch infor from WD or Scholia taxon
> For now their is connection with Wikipedia see https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/169521-Tabernaemontana-divaricata As you can see some even have a Phytochemistry section. Could be a nice way to improve chemical descriptions ?
