# This is Disha's DBGI daily open-notebook.

## Doing 
1. Looked at PheObs, AusTraits and Globi. Globi has to be integrated. AusTraits looks very promising. Have to see how they integrated data. It is mostly manual curation, but impressive

## Done 
1. Meeting with Philip from Science-et-cite went ok. He said to pursue the video idea (interview with PIs and junior researchers, pseudoscience??). Gave contacts for people who can help with making videos. 

From Philip:

Daniel Saraga:

Mirko Bischofberger (also a film maker):

And this is Manuela Dahinden from the Zurich Basel Plant Science Center:

2. Creating ontop VKG for the try-traits data, respective taxonomic ids, and enplkg data (raw materials, taxon names, wd_id, organ, broad_organ) for only small subset of data. Git repo created on https://github.com/mdrishti/integrate_trydb.

## Notes

## Todo tomorrow or soon

1. Transfer the integrate_trydb from my github account to DBGI's.
2. Incorporate ttl files for traits on the ontop VKG for coherence.
3. Perform extensive tests with integrate_trydb VVKG. Check at all levels with SPARQL. Validate the results.
