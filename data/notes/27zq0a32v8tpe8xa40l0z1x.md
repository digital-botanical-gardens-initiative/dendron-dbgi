https://doi.org/10.1039/d2np00008c
 . 
Daniel Mietchen says:Now looking for a way to find papers by license... 
16:28
E
Emma
Emma says:There is "preach to the converted" vs "trying to convert" ... as long as our article is open, it's meaningful right? 
16:30
DM
Daniel Mietchen
Daniel Mietchen says:But RDF does not work well for opinion pieces 
16:31
E
Emma
Emma says:RDF does not work well for many things 
Emma says:and it is a lot less accessible to mere mortals than a PDF

16:33
DM
Daniel Mietchen
Daniel Mietchen says:I thought it was already clarified that our article would be open, even in this journal. 
16:34
E
Emma
Emma says:I thought so too 
16:34

me says:Obviously 
me says:The thing is that the JOURNAL is not Open 
me says:I dont care that much ... 
16:34
DM
Daniel Mietchen

16:38
E
Emma
Emma says:great, we could add to e.g. PubChem if it's open 
16:38
SŒ¶
score(œÜ)
score(œÜ) says:Both are not "classical" NPR articles reporting occurrences but rather reviews of methodologies 
score(œÜ) says:Not sure there is much to mine there in terms of structures/taxa pairs 
16:40
E
Emma
Emma says:hmm that's a pity 
16:40
DM
Daniel Mietchen
Daniel Mietchen says:There was a paper "Adventures in Semantic Publishing: Exemplar Semantic Enhancements of a Research Article", of which we could do a 15-year anniversary celebration by annotating such a NPR paper and turning it into a knowledge graph. Link: 
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000361

DM
Daniel Mietchen
