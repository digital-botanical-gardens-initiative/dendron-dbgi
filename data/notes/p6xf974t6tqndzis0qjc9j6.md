A research proposal should be written in order to briefly but clearly present the DBGI to potential collaborators and funders.
The idea is to draft a 4-5 page proposal that could eventually be published at RIO

The document is available and editable at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UYcAk1JyJzV_KIBxW2G8ILnNyV3jImBqroW4ESFVQfw/edit?usp=sharing
A version (DBGI_proposal_v0.1) as been saved today Sunday 12 June 2022
