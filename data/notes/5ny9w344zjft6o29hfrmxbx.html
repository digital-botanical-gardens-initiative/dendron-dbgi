<p>To monitor changes in analyses over time, we would like to set up a control system. 5 plantes were selected (dbgi_001028; dbgi_001029; dbgi_001030; dbgi_001031; dbgi_001032). Plant were lyophilized and conserved at -80°C </p>

<ul>
<li>5 g of grinded plant (with a motar) is extracted in 250 mL of methanol 100% using ultrasound bath during 30 minutes. </li>
<li>The mixture is filtered on paper filter  </li>
<li>The supernatant is transfered in tared balloon and evorapoted to dryness using a rotary evaporator </li>
<li>The dry extract is then solubilized at 5 mg/mL using methanol. Solutions are aliquotated (800 µL in 1.5 mL vial) and conserved in the freezer. 100 vials of 800 µL are realised per plant.
