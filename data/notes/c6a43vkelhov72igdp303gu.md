## TODO

- [x] Resolve cronjob problem (update db)
- [?] Pswd in cronjob

### If everything done before end of day
- [ ] go on with the tutorial

## CODE

### Resolve cronjob problem
Problem => python file couldn't execute because the environment wasn't activated

Solved by creating a bash script that activate the environment and run the script next

```bash
 #!/bin/bash
 
 \#activate environment
 source /home/mwannier/anaconda3/bin/activate taxonomical-preparator

 \#go to python file directory
 cd /home/mwannier/taxonomical-preparator/src

 \#run python script
 python inat_fetcher.py

 \# deactivate environment
 conda deactivate
```

### Pswd in cronjob
Problem => pswd visible in cronjob
But still only on local (just like .env file) so is it really a problem?

### Show images from url on directus
Install extension?

I couldn't find a solution today

## TODO NEXT

- Show images from url on directus
- go on with the tutorial
