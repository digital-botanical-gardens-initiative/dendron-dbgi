<p>The Falcon mode permits to attribute the field samples to a container. When teh user enters the mode, he is asked to scan a valid container (<em>Figure 1</em>).</p>

<p>The scan of a rack is mandatory to continue the process (<em>Figure 2</em>). This forces the users to track correctly the samples and to avoid errors. If the samples can't be stored in a valid container, the user can declare them absent. This signifies that the samples are expected to be stored individually because of their big size (<em>Figure 3</em>).</p>

<p>Once the user has scanned a valid rack or declared the samples as absent from a rack, the user can proceed to samples scanning to attribute them (<em>Figures 3 and 4</em>)</p>
