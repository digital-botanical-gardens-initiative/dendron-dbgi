## Doing

## Quality control for MS analysis
To monitor changes in analyses over time, we would like to set up a control system. 5 plantes were selected (dbgi_001028; dbgi_001029; dbgi_001030; dbgi_001031; dbgi_001032)

### Protocol : 
- 5 g of grinded plant (with a motar) is extracted in 250 mL of methanol 100% using ultrasound bath during 30 minutes. 
- The mixture is filtered on paper filter  
- The supernatant is transfered in tared balloon and evorapoted to dryness using a rotary evaporator 
- The dry extract is then solubilized at 5 mg/mL using methanol and aliquotate and conserved in the freezer. 100 vials of 800 ÂµL are realised per plant.
