Dear all
 
Unfortunately, I must go to the doctor with my son at 10 am. Would it be possible to postpone our meeting to 11.30? I am very sorry to cause an inconvenience.
 
Her my suggestion for an abstract we could use to get into discussions with the interaction designers:
 
Imagine an immersive multimedia exhibition called "The World of Plant Metabolites" that takes visitors on a journey through the intricate realm of plant chemistry. As visitors enter the Botanical Garden in Neuchatel, they are greeted with interactive screens showcasing stunning data visualizations of plant metabolomes, highlighting the complexity and diversity of these compounds.
In one section, visitors can explore an interactive app on tablets or smartphones that allows them to virtually "zoom in" on specific plant metabolites, learning about their structures, functions, and potential applications in medicine and nutrition. They can also participate in quizzes and games to test their knowledge and understanding.
Another highlight of the exhibition is a live demonstration area where plant scientists, chemists, and bioinformaticians conduct experiments and analyses in real-time. Visitors can watch as samples are collected, analyzed, and interpreted, gaining insight into the cutting-edge research methods used to study plant metabolites.
Throughout the exhibition, engaging multimedia presentations and guided tours provide further opportunities for visitors to learn and interact. Interactive touchscreens allow visitors to explore curated datasets and visualizations, deepening their understanding of plant metabolomics in an accessible and engaging way.
By combining data visualization, interactive apps, live demonstrations, and multimedia presentations, "The World of Plant Metabolites" offers an exciting and educational experience that brings the fascinating world of plant chemistry to life for the public.
 
For Agora projects it is essential, that the audience can interact with scientists. We should also consider a school program with focus on data literacy.
 
Looking forward to discuss this further with you.
 
Best
Manuela



 
Thanks Manuela, for providing the documents. I will get back to you soon on this. I have summarized some points discussed in the meeting:
 
- We should focus on botanical garden exhibition
- A video of researchers explaining what they do may not be enough for the big grant (200000 CHF). If we plan to make a video, we need to  somehowinclude interaction with the public in the video.
- Idea-2 (data literacy) can be followed-up, but with several modifications.
- Main objective of the AGORA project: Transfer knowledge on chemo-diversity to the general people.
- In the context of data literacy idea, we should build a data visualization platform in collaboration with people from 'ikonaut', present our idea to them and brainstorm how we can make the visualization of our knowledge graph better for the general visitors of the botanical garden. This platform can be hosted on individual tablets in the botanical garden, so that people can use it to gain information about the plants within the botanical garden. 
- On the lines of data visualization, we can also build an app for mobiles in parallel, which people can use for deriving information on chemo-diversity in botanical gardens and beyond. We can create different levels in this app for kids and adults.
- There might be other applications which may focus on the concept of chemo-diversity. We should keep in mind that we don't re-invent the wheel. This is important for the novelty part of the AGORA grant.
