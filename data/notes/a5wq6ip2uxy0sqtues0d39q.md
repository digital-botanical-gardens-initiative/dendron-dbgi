Update on what has been done for the detection of chemical entities from pdf.
Two novels annotation sources have been been used for this iteration (PubChem + LOTUS (obtained from lotus.naturalproducts.net))

Use of the RO https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ro (relation ontology) to detected biotic interaction.
