Hello RO people ! Disclaimer: I am very new to RO and the ontology world in general please excuse me in case I say any absurdities.

I would like to find the appropriate RO property to express the fact that a given molecule has been found in a given taxon. In LOTUS (an electronic ressource documenting occurence of small molecules across the tree of life) we have used the Wikidata P703 "found_in_taxon" property. E.g. erythromycin is found in taxon Aeromicrobium erythreum. Now I somehow found that the https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/in_taxon/ LinkML model states that this in_taxon is exactly mapped to RO:0002162 and P703.  Before using RO:0002162 I would like to make sure that there is no better suited property.

One thing that made doubt is the fact that the description states : "Connects a biological entity to its taxon of origin." and that I am here trying to link a chemical entity to its taxon of origin. 
The other doubt I had was that "Connects a biological entity to its taxon of origin." could also be interpreted as organism X (for example this specimen defined by an iNaturalist observation) is connected to its taxon of origin in this case Arabidopsis thaliana (55021 or Q158695)
