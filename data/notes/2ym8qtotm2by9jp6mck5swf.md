### Today Notes & ideas
last wednesday (27th april) we have tested some extraction technics. Firstly, we have used lyophilized plants and we have tried to make powder with it on 5ml eppendorf, then on 50ml falcon tubes with big glass beads, little glass beads and little metal beads. It didn't work very well. The solution we found is to use 2ml rounded bottom eppendorf tubes with 3 little metal beads in it and then pass it 3 minutes in the Retsch at a 30khz frequency. The result is the best with this technic and make a really fine powder that can be considered as homogeneised. Firstly we tried to pmake powder with the full plant sample, but it didn't work well. So, with the 2ml rounded eppendorf tubes, it's better to weight before making powder. So we weighted 50 micrograms of plants regarding we put all the parts of the leafs in it. Then we make powder with Retsch and 3 beads in the 2ml eppendorf tubes. Then we add 1.7 microlitters of 80% methanol, 20% water and 0.1% formic acid to extract the components. We then put in the Retsch again to homogeneise (don't know how much time). Then we put (I don't know how much time at which frequency) in the centrifugation. Lastly, we prelevate 1 microlitters of the supernatant and put it in a little glass tube (I forgot the name).
