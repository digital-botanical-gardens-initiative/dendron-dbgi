I had an idea to facilitate the adding of a layer on QGIS by making a python plugin for QGIS. This plugin will create a layer and set up it, so that everybody can create it without prior knowing on QGIS.

I created a repository for that, that can be followed here: https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/QGIS_plugin
