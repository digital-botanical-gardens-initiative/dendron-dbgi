Asked help from chatgpt to create the thesis outline:

I. Introduction
  - Background and motivation for the project (Presentation of DBGI / LOTUS?)
  - Brief overview of the research problem and objectives

II. Literature Review
  - (Overview of the relevant literature related to plant metabolites, LCMS profiles, and knowledge graphs)
  - Discussion of existing research on creating data dashboards and using SPARQL queries for data visualization

III. Methodology
  - Description of the data sources and how they were collected and processed (LOTUS + DBGI)
  - (Details on the development of the knowledge graph and how it will be used to feed the dashboard)
  - Discussion of the software tools and programming languages used to build the dashboard and interface with the knowledge graph and LCMS profiles

IV. Dashboard Development
  - Presentation of the dashboard interface and its various features and components
  - Discussion of the key statistics and visualizations displayed on the dashboard, and how they relate to the research objectives
  - (Examples of SPARQL queries used to extract information from the knowledge graph and visualize it on the dashboard)

V. Code Optimization
  - Discussion of how the code was optimized for efficiency and speed
  - Overview of the methods and techniques used to improve code performance, such as caching, parallelization, and algorithmic improvements
  - Presentation of performance benchmarks and comparisons to demonstrate the improvements achieved

VI. Discussion
  - Interpretation of the results and their implications for plant metabolite research and data visualization
  - Comparison of the proposed dashboard to existing tools and methods
  - Limitations of the study and potential avenues for future research

VII. Conclusion
  - Summary of the key findings and contributions of the thesis
  - Implications for the field of plant metabolite research and data visualization
  - Suggestions for future research

VIII. References
  - List of all references cited in the thesis

IX. Appendices
  - Additional technical details on the development of the dashboard and knowledge graph, as well as sample SPARQL queries and LCMS profiles used in the study
