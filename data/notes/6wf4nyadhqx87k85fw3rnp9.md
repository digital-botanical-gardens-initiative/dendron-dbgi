## Notes
Today, together with Edouard, I looked at the plant samples that we froze dry last week. 3 out of 5 not sliced succulents were still wet. 
- dbgi_000921: sliced and dbgi_000919: not sliced --> not completely dry!
- dbgi_000992: sliced and dbgi_001013: not sliced --> not completely dry!
- dbgi_000991: sliced and dbgi_000913: not sliced
- dbgi_000915: sliced and dbgi_001017: not sliced --> not completely dry!
- dbgi_000922: sliced and dbgi_000998: not sliced 

This means that when I take the samples I have to decide whether to slice them or not, and with the larger succulent leaves it has now been shown that it is worth slicing them. 

Questions for the meeting on Thursday, 09.03.2023:
- Is it now possible to dry the 3 not quite dry samples again?
- Because of the pregnancy I cannot work in the lab, should I put the balance in Edouard's office and weigh there? 
- Should I work with liquid nitrogen or with silica gel en orange perles?
