This is Disha's DBGI daily open-notebook.

 

## Doing
1. #VKG modify TRY-db csv file to include 1 column explaining the data type (one of the folloiwng three values): continuous-trait, discrete-trait, non-trait to distinguish between quuantitative & non-quanititattive trait and non trait data
2. #SciComm In talks with Manuela Dahinden to shape the AGORA grant. Meeting on 17th May with Manuela, Emmanuel and Pierr-Marie.
3. Start Intro for the paper.
4. Discussion with Manu today on:
a) Run queries with only plants from ENPKG. Think abut what the user wants. 

b) Similarity matrices for traits: scaling followed by euclidean and bray-curtis. how about mixing them (take avg) and then plot node distance based on the avg distance, different edge coloring/width by distance specific to a metric.

c) human-plant interaction. Is there a database which lists plants edible?

d) Manu will provide climate change data from GBIF or from GIFT.


## Done  
In the last 2 weeks, I did the following:
1. #VKG Ontop setup and sparql endpoint on UniFr machine

## Todo tomorrow or soon

1. #SciComm Philipp gave contacts for people who can help with making videos. 

From Philip:

2. #VKG Incorporate ttl files for traits on the ontop VKG for coherence.
3. #SciComm Build a graphical overview of the two ideas discussed with Manuela.

## Today I learned that

## Paused

9. Profile article for the DBGI website. 
10. DISPEL conversation.
11. Looked at PheObs, AusTraits and Globi. AusTraits looks very promising. Have to see how they integrated data.
