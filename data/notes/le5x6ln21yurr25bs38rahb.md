## Notes
After a little search to find someone to fetch the samples from the freezer in the lab, everything went well. Everything worked with the freeze-dryer and I am excited and really hopeful that the samples will all be really dry. I'm still a bit sceptical as there are some really thick succulents underneath. 
I'll continue with the collection straight away, as I really want to be finished with the succulent and cactus greenhouse by the end of my Bachelor's project on 1 June 2023. 
Now I just have to look for liquid nitrogen, because there are delivery problems at the moment...
As a temporary solution, ice is now the substitute for liquid nitrogen. I simply had to put the samples in the freezer after 20 minutes. 

Edouard and I went shopping for tape this afternoon. So I taped the QR code labels to the tubes, otherwise they would come off after being in the freezer. 

It wasn't easy with the collection today because I had a few plants with big spines.
