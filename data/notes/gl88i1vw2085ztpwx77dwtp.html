<p>As results, we have obtained a molecular network composed of 80 plants of 40 different species (40 samples with silica gel and 40 samples with liquid nitrogen) for more than 9700 features.</p>

<p>We can see below that a large majority of compounds are conserved across both sampling methods despite some minor differences. After an organisation of the samples based on chemistery ploted with a phylogenetic tree (second image below), we have seen that most species couples are located at the same position of the tree. That indicates a global conservation of the metabolites between the 2 methods.</p>

<p>These results have been obtained by profiling the plants less than one month after the sampling. Therefor, it is not guaranteed that these results are true for older stored samples.</p>

<p>For now, we haven't really observed the chemical features in detail, because hat wasn't the principle goal of this work. It will probably come later on.</p>
