<p>Of the 12 samples that were unfortunately stored somewhere in the wrong place, 8 were totally damp and with mould. So I had to collect them again. Audrey has reserved the freeze dryer for the weekend and is taking the samples with her. So the process is delayed once again â˜¹.</p>
<p>Then the other 6 samples that aren't on iNaturalist &#x26; QField app, I haven't figured out where the error is or where those are coming from either. I have also looked at the samples and have no idea. They are dried and marked with a question mark and are there now (in case something comes out). But they are not extracted etc. because it is unclear where they come from or what is wrong with them.</p>
<p>The missing pictures for iNaturalist: that was a lot of work and cost me a lot of nerves. However, they are now on iNaturalist. Unfortunately there are still 5 plants missing and I just can't figure out which ones they are. I have 15 dbgi code that could be them but I can't find them on the QField app. </p>
<p>This week has been kind of just ironing out problems &#x26; realising that I'm done with the collection in the succulent greenhouse but won't have the evaluations for my bachelorwork. Well, I will write and present wat i have and that is quite a lot. Now it's important for me to be able to write my Bachelorwork and finish it soon. Sometimes I'm afraid that the baby will come and I won't be able to finish it.
I can also look at the results of the mass spectrometry after I've submitted my bachelorwork (just because I'm interested).</p>
