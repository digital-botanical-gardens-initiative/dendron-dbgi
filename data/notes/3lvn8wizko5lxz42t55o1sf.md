## Notes
### Notes on predictions in LOTUS
**Problem** : there is a species `Q15526756` that has no taxonomy because the wikidata of this item does not exist anymore. Indeed when searching for it, it redirects to this : https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18077380 which is the page of the species. This results that when we get the taxonomy on wikidata we have an empty dataframe. This results that the species is closer to the molecules that to the species.

## Todo today
- [x] add remote to anticipated lotus
- [x] add files to zenodo in lotus initiative (output of all_species phylogeny)
- [ ] add metadata of results of predictions in lotus
- [ ] look at polars instead of pandas
- [ ] (think about streamlit app)
