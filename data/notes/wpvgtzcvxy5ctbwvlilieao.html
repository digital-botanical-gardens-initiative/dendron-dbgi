<p>Frezze dryer, room 0.320 --> always book early at openiris.io (science-it.ch).
Turn right
Turn left to close
Select programme P1. There are 3 cycles of 24 h. We need 2 = 48 h.
Attention: Check if the freezer hole is free of ice and clean it with household paper. It should be cleaned after use.
Then we put a round plexiglass part on it. Large rounding towards the bottom and small rounding towards the top, then a yellow/green square on top and then the tube where the samples go in.
Make sure that the closures are well closed (turn to the left) otherwise there will be no vacuum.
Before the start on Procycling and then after the start (wait approx. 2 min) and make sure that it is minus 70 and at 3 mbar.
The principle of the freeze dryer: Freeze drying is based on the physical process of sublimation: In this process, the ice crystals sublime directly into the gaseous state without the intermediate appearance of a liquid phase. The end product of freeze-drying is called lyophilisate.</p>
<p>Important, after the dry freezer I have to replace the lids of the samples with those without holes. </p>
<p>Today it was more pleasant than yesterday to collect the plant fragments. It was less hot. Everything went well so far. </p>
<p>I was now able to book the freeze dryer for the following dates:</p>
