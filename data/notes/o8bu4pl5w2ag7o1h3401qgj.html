<ul>
<li>The goal of KG Hub is to serve as a collective resource to simplify the process of generating biological and biomedical KGs and thus reducing the barrier for entry to new participants</li>
<li>In a KG Hub, each independent effort for building a KG is an instance of the KG Hub</li>
<li>Each KG follows a set of design principles, one of which is the use of Biolink Model as a schema</li>
<li>Also provides recommendations on set of design patterns to use for building and exchanging KGs</li>
