Cytotoxic sesquiterpene lactones from Campuloclinium macrocephalum (= Eupatorium macrocephalum)


Donat introduced the possibility to dicuemnt a Physical Object using a Zenodo repo.
Uses keywords and controlled vocabulary from Darwin core. Can be customized

### Some points discussed

#### linking iNaturalist observations and GBIF

- examples ?
- Issues because observations for botanical gardens specimens correspond to "cultivated" categorie, hence no "research grade" quality in iNat, so not taken up by GBIF

#### how do we label an individual ?

A priori we can identify an observation (e.g. an iNat observation id https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/160942639)
A priori we can label a species corresponding to this observation (e.g iNat taxa id https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/168422-Sansevieria-cylindrica or GBIF https://www.gbif.org/species/2770617)
A priori we can label the physical objects (dried powder, extracts etc) linked to an observation (in this case the emi_external_id dbgi_000512, present on the iNat observation page + inhouse)

However we do not know how to efficiently identify the **individual** corresponding to an observation.

- is it required to do so ?
- If we can, we should 

Some specific problems : 

- How do we deal with organism where tthe identification of an "individual" is complicated if not impossible ?
  - carpophore of an undergrounds fungi
  - plants, lichens, animals or soil and water samples containing multiple other species (endop'hytes, associated microbiome etc.)


### Some issues posted following the discussion


Examples of an observation of multiple species / organism simultaneously #4823
https://github.com/gbif/portal-feedback/issues/4823

example of organism with multiple occurrences #4822
https://github.com/gbif/portal-feedback/issues/4822

To be followed up possibly in 7-10 days.

## Paused

## Done

## Notes


- For next OpenBis meeting:

- can we display picture from hyperlinks
- can we display maps from lat/lon coordinates
- we cannot use the API (both as user or admin) see issue on Rostyk 
  - the creation of a PAT apparently didn't solve the issue
- have a one2one and a one2many links examples
- see for upload of a simple csv from the UI
- try to pass current Directus tables to OpenBis
- updates on QRcodes

## Todo tomorrow
