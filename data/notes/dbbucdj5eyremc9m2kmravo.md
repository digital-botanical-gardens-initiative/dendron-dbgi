Part of the Knowledge Dissemination aspects of the DBGI include exploring new ways for the publication of research outputs.

One question that we would like to investigate is wether it is possible to publish these outputs as a research consortium.
The idea would be to have a the DBGI consortium as unique author and a contribution table in the article (following [CREDIT](https://credit.niso.org/) system or similar) detailing each authors contribution.

This would have several advantages : 

- moving away from the eternal dilemna of determining who should be first / second / third / last (colast !)
- a clear identification of the DBGI / EMI initiatives 

However we need to find the correct way to implement this. 
ORCIDs are apparently not made for research groups.
