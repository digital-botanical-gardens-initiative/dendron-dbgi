Discussion with Pierre-Marie about the analysis of the batch in progress. No analyse before 2023. But needs some preparations

To prepare : 
- 20 samples of the first batch, 10 with silica and 10 with liquid nitrogen to see how it conserves. From the plant samples
- 20 samples of the first extract batch to control the quality of the conserved extracts. From the plant extracts
- Prepare the new and old samples to the analysis (300microliter in the inserts)

Labels are not working very well, possibility to have a labeler, or find a good process to print labels correctly
