## Notes
Today I looked at the samples that were in the freeze dryer last week and weighed them. It should be about 47.5 mg to 52.5 mg. The plant samples then go into a small tube, with 3 beads and of course labelled with the dbgi number. 
Edouard and I have tried to use an old Android phone to get around the excessively large pictures on the iPhone, but unfortunately without success. I will continue to take the pictures with my iPhone and then compress them.

I have uploaded about 40 plants to iNaturalist.
