## Notes


Meeting this afternoon with @Edefossez @edouardbruelhart and @mwannier30

Several points were discussed:

- concerning the upload of specimens informations to iNaturalist it was decide that the QRCode should be the privileged way to upload the DBGI_sample_id. And instead of containing the airtable link (as it does now) it should contain the raw dbgi sample id.


Regarding the dbgi identifiers : 

- it was decided that the _DBGI sample identifiers_ should be written in the following format:
`dbgi_000001` instead of the previously used `DBGI_SPL_000001`. So lower case and no SPL specification

- it was decided that the _DBGI extracts identifiers_ will be labeled as follow : `dbgi_000001_01` indicating extract 01 of sample `dbgi_000001`
