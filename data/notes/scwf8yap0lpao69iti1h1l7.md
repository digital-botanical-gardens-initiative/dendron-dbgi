# Wikibase

This is the main topic of the workshop.

We will start at 11:00 in room PER21 E040 (Bd de Pérolles 90, rez-de-chaussée) in Fribourg. 
We will stream the discussions at https://meet.jit.si/DBGI_talks and maybe through Teams if issues.

Try to have a Wikimedia login and also to log over there https://dbgi-sandbox.wikibase.cloud/wiki/Main_Page

We have a discussion opened over there : https://github.com/orgs/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/discussions/14

# Others


We will also take advantage to have Daniel around to discuss other topics.
Here are some :

> 
> Hi Pierre,
> 
> good to have that Wikibase instance - I just requested an account.
> Everyone participating in the workshop would ideally have an account
> on it beforehand.
> Having a Wikimedia account would be useful too (especially to test
> some tooling) but is not essential.
> 
> If need be, we can use one of my Wikibase sandboxes, e.g.
> https://ecology-22.wikibase.cloud/wiki/Main_Page .
> For a more complete Wikibase setup, you can look into
> https://github.com/MaRDI4NFDI/portal-compose ,
> which runs https://portal.mardi4nfdi.de/wiki/Portal .
> Here, I have to caution that I am an advanced user but a novice admin.
> 
> Besides Wikibase technicalities, I would also like to discuss other
> open aspects of the project, e.g. interactions with
> the Wikimedia community more broadly as well as with places like RIO,
> https://www.protocols.io/file-manager or https://jogl.io/ or
> https://soils4europe.eu/ or https://sensor.community/en/ . I am also
> involved in other projects that may or may not lend
> themselves to collaboration with DBGI and/ or EMI, e.g. this one
> freshly submitted this week: https://beehind.org/ .
