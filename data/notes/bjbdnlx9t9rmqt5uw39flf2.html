<li>DBGI main structure and EMI longer term vision (presented by PM, slides at <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7662428"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7662428.svg" alt="DOI"></a>)</li>

<p><img src="/dendron-dbgi/assets/images/2023-02-24-08-06-14.png" alt="Roles of scientific advisors" style="width:70%;"></p>
<p>Explained and resumed in the previous screenshot (original pdf at <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7663471"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7663471.svg" alt="DOI"></a>))</p>
<p>They will all be poked and asked for advice as much as needed (they will tell us if no time to help or if too frequently contacted). All are of course more than welcome to imply themselves more according to their interest (e.g. Daniel will possibly lead a Wikibase workshop in March)</p>
<p>üóíÔ∏è note that the dotted links correspond to the main area where advisors are expected to help, they can of course be extended. E.g Jakub can help on the visualization and interfacing with the KG, Daniel and Egon are of course knowledgeable on semantic data aspects.</p>

<p><img src="/dendron-dbgi/assets/images/2023-02-24-08-13-25.png" alt="Roles of DBGI-KM team" style="width:70%;"></p>
<p>Roles and actors have been clarified see previous screenshot (original pdf at <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7663471"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7663471.svg" alt="DOI"></a>).</p>
<p><strong>WP2 Sample tracking system establishment</strong> Henry and Caterina will be our contact persons in this project for the openBIS and sample tracking system establishment. However there will be a wider team of data scientists and dev implied (who will be funded by the Swiss DBGI-KM ORD grant). Bernd will coordinate this on the ETH side. </p>
<p><strong>WP3 Knowledge representation and graph establishment</strong> Ana and Tarcisio will be two contact persons AND effectively two actors here. They will be funded by the Swiss DBGI-KM ORD grant.</p>
<p>Both for the WP2 and WP3 teams, it is OK to have an "official start" on the <strong>1st March 2023</strong>, wether or not the money has been liberated from the swissuniversities.</p>
<p>It was announced that Tomas Walker (UniNe) will be contracted as postdoc, starting June 2023 under Manu's supervision, for the <strong>WP5 Community Engagement, Public Outreach and Biodiversity Conservation part</strong>. We mentioned that we should look for a  candidate for <strong>WP4 Human Data Interaction</strong>. Postdocs roles were not discussed in details.</p>

<p>This meeting was important to get thing rolling. The program was a bit overambitious and we couldn't address all points.
We are setting up several upcoming workshops which will be more focussed in their thematic.
Anyone is welcome to join them. </p>

<h4 id="wikibase-workshop">Wikibase workshop<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#wikibase-workshop"></a></h4>
<p>(Daniel) In CH end of March 29-30 possibly few days earlier maybe in person.</p>
<h3 id="focussed-workgroup">Focussed workgroup<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#focussed-workgroup"></a></h3>
<p>A small working group will be set up to <em><strong>better understand the legal and ethics aspects of sample collection</strong></em>.
With the EMI in mind but also for the DBGI.</p>
<p>Anne-Laure will coordinate this on JBN side.
Daniel is interested in ethics aspects and will possibly participate.</p>
