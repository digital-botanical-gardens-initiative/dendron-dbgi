<p>Tried to do a plot to visualize molecular diversity
A t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) or UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) plot could be useful for this purpose. Both are dimensionality reduction techniques that can help visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D. You can use these techniques to visualize the similarity between molecules based on their features.</p>
<p>First needed to convert your molecular data into numerical features => As it is computationaly demanding, I created a script (<a href="https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/dashboard/blob/2fd9559bae8da9c1fe287dc1818d23926b8c8b47/smiles_to_ecfp.py">'smiles_to_ecfp.py'</a>) that is running outside the app (maybe once everyday?) and that add the values to a table ('umap') in the 'lotus' postgresql database.<br>
Was trying to use umap at first but it was too memory consuming so I switched to t-SNE. It gives me a result that can be ploted but it is still computationally demanding and I should find another way or adapt this technique to visualize the diversity faster.</p>
