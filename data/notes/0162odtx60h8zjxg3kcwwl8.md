# This is Edouard's DBGI daily open-notebook.

Today is 2022.11.22

# Perspectives
Try to add more than one picture in a row to make the QField process easier and faster.

Try to modify location metadata of the pictures to directly add the precise location from QField to iNaturalist without adding by hand.

If possible, trying to add the dbgi ID automatically in iNaturalist via QR codes in QField

# done
Succeeded to add pictures to QField. Possibility to rename the pictures with the species, and then have an automatic identification on iNaturalist. For now, only one picture can be added by field. Usable actually, but not so practical in the field.
