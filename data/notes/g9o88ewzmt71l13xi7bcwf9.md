With Flatterer you can:

easily convert JSON to flat relational data such as CSV, XLSX, Database Tables, Pandas Dataframes and Parquet;
convert JSON into data packages, so you can use Frictionless data to convert into any database format;
create a data dictionary that contains metadata about the conversion, including fields contained in the dataset, to help you understand the data you are looking at;
create a new table for each one-to-many relationship, alongside _link fields that help to join the data together.
