## Notes
Regarding yesterday's correction: it is unclear to say that only the large leaves of the succulents that have not been cut are not completely dry. This means that I can't just cut the large succulent leaves because smaller ones that have not been cut are not dry either. Besides, it is time-consuming, dangerous (you could hurt yourself) and the plants are exposed to stress when I slice them. 
- Therefore, in future I will not slice the succulents but I can dry them several times in the dry freezer. Also, it might be good not to fill the freezer too much, that could also give a better result. This means I will use the freezer a lot, but unfortunately it is not always available. One option is to buy an additional one. This will probably not affect me any more as my bachelor project ends on 01.06.202023.
- We can't really move the scale from the lab to another place. It is extremely sensitive and expensive. Buying an additional one is an option, but also a question of time and money. So it would mean if Edouard and Stefanie could do it for me?
- I need a list of the plants I need to collect in the greenhouse.

AFTERNOON:
There is a scale I can use "Mettler Toledo". 
I now also have the list of plants I will collect in the greenhouse. There are 341 succulents and cacti, but which ones have more than one specimen, so there are probably just over 200 that I have to collect. 
I have photographed the plants for which the drying worked and those for which it did not and I have also deposited them here under vault-assets-images_lendita.
