### What do we have ?

- ENPKG 

https://enpkg.commons-lab.org/graphdb/
https://enpkg.commons-lab.org/

The idea for now is to fork the ENPKG repos on the DBGI organisation.
We will build on these, at least for the MS > RDF part. 



### What do we want ?

- DBGI-KG
- EMI-KG

- Wikibase. Is this an option ? 
How complicated ? Does someone has experience in setting these up ?
https://wikiba.se/


Daniel's opinion : it's worth exploring.

Could serve as a backup for iNat
Could facilitate integration with iNat ?
Wikibase <-> WD is straightforward.


1. start by Using existing WikiBase 

Scholia could work with any Wikibase (cg Egon hackaton proposal at SWAT) See at ![[meetings.2023.02.22.program.notes.wp4#hacking-scholia-for-custom-sparql-endpoints]]


Daniel runs his own instance Wikibase instance.


Downside : additional efforts to set up  
Why not do it on WD directly ?

WD doesn't want specimens informations.
We have data at higher granularity.
Several ways to test this https://www.wikibase.cloud/
Need a Wikimedia account 


Will set up a small meeting with Daniel. 

(PMA) I just signed up for a wikibase.cloud account. They are apparently in closed beta for now https://www.wikibase.cloud/
