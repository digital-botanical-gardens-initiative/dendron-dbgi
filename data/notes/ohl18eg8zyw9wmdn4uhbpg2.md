## Notes
So the last pictures are on iNaturalist. All samples weighed. And I couldn't quite finish collecting in the greenhouse, unfortunately. I was kicked out of the greenhouse at 6pm. But I'll finish the rest tomorrow. 
There were discussions about the freeze dryer again. It's a bit annoying because I'll only need it 1-2 times and have to reschedule my whole week, but I'll manage somehow. I can use it this weekend from Friday morning to Monday morning. 
I'm a bit impatient that I won't be able to do it all by the end of term on 1.6. But it's not much and then in 1-2 weeks I should watch it with Pierre-Marie. Then we'll need this device (which I've now forgotten the name of). I'm curious ðŸ˜Š
