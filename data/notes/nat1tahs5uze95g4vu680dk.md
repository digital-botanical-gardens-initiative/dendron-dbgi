If you are new into the DBGI and EMI projects and you want to collect samples, here is the tutorial to do it:

1. Go [there](https://emi-collection.unifr.ch/accounts/signup/) to create an account on the collection server. An error will occur, but your account have been registered. You won't need to use this webpage again.

2. Communicate the username of you newly created account and the specific project you want to join (JBN, JBUF, EMI, ...) to Edouard Br√ºlhart (edouard.bruelhart@unifr.ch). Wait the adding (manual so it can take some hours/days).

Now you are part of the project you chose. Following your needs, you can create your own layer by following this [tutorial](https://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi/notes/qug423ond4xtns8lelu38p2/). If you already have a layer to collect, you can follow this [tutorial](https://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi/notes/fkbclzsoo3zgkkvgrlsg26g/) to begin the collection process.
