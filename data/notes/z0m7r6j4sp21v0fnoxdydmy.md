## Goals

<!-- Main objectives of the meeting -->

Some points to be adressed at [[open-notebook.dbgi.lcappelletti.2023.07.25]]

* Call with [Pierre-Marie Allard](https://www.unifr.ch/bio/en/services/metabolomics-and-proteomics-platform/people/335736/16398) to discuss the [ENPKG Workflow](https://github.com/enpkg/enpkg_workflow)
    * Write a command that runs for the test data [made available on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/8152039) that can be later adapted to be a test suite.

We used the downloaders lib https://pypi.org/project/downloaders/
Should we automate the peak-picking on the long term ? Some issues here ... the GUI is pretty usefull for quality control.

To be checked later on.
