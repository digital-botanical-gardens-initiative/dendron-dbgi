Working on setting up the emi-monorepo dockers on the COMMONS ubuntiu server

https://github.com/earth-metabolome-initiative/emi-monorepo/blob/b5cf8ebc6fc79917f10ea667203d5c1bad74d65f/web/CONTRIB.md

The web_commons will play a buffer role between the backend and the frontend and will be used to avoid code duplication and share structs and functions between the two.


In parallel work on ms-annotator

Starting to refactor with Marco


What are the minimal required inputs

- 1 spectral file (handled by matchms)

- 1 metadata table
- 1 quantification table

We will in fact check wether we could nbot plainly use matchms and propose evcentualla addition to their pipelines
