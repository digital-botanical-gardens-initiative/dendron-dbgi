After the meeting yesterday, Edouard helped me download Dendron, GitHub, Zulip, QField and installed everything I needed. That took some time after all...  

Today we finished the installations of the various platforms I need to work. That also took time and patience ;). 

Edourad showed me what we need to collect the samples in the greenhouse. 
- kitchen paper
- gloves
- Tube with the Q-code
- Scalpel
- Coffee filter paper
- Disinfectant (ethanol)
- Liquid nitrogen
- Mobile phone with the QField app

I took a few samples of the plants in the greenhouse where the succulents and cacti are. To test the drying method I also took two samples from each plant: one sliced and one not. 
- dbgi_000921: sliced and dbgi_000919: not sliced ---> XXX
- dbgi_000992: sliced and dbgi_001013: not sliced -->XXX
- dbgi_000991: sliced and dbgi_000913: not sliced 
- dbgi_000915: sliced and dbgi_001017: not sliced -->XXX
- dbgi_000922: sliced and dbgi_000998: not sliced

Sampling the plants in the greenhouse:
- Marking the exact location in the QField app on the map of the Botanic Garden.
- Find the name of the corresponding plant
- Scan the Q-code of the tube
- Take pictures: 1. picture of the panel, 2. whole picture of the plant with the red arrow   pointing to the plant, 3. picture of details of the plant, 4. picture of the cut of the plant, 5. picture of the tube and the panel together
- Clean scalpel with ethanol 
- Remove plant sample with scalpel, wrap in coffee filter paper, put in tube and place in box with liquid nitrogen.
- Clean the scalpel again with ethanol for the next sample.

We then froze the tubes at -68 degrees.

## Notes

Today I collected some plants to test the drying method. Here are the couples of each plant, once sliced, once not:
