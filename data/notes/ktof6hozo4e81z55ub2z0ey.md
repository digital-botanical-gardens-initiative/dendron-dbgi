The automatization of pictures import is on a good way. Since now, I could construct an automated pathway that checks every project where a dedicated user (created for the automatization) is part of, downloads all the .gpkg and .jpg present on each, converts the .gpkg in .csv to read the informations about, converts the coordinates, whatever is the CRS source, in coordinates compatible with iNaturalist. I'll post this code later, when the process will be all done (because the code may change).

The metadata edition is fast working. I just have a subfolder problem (can't add a subfolder level in the path to the csv file that contains the dbgi code and the coordinates to assign to the pictures metadata). But it's finished for today. I will manage that tomorrow or thursday.
