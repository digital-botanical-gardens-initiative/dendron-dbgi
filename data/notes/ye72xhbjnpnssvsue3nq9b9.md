## Starting the day

First lets check the last discussions on the forum https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/forum/discussions

### Today's Todo 

- [ ] See with the botanical garden collaborators when we can make the cartography of the botanical garden.
- [ ] Rework the mothodology
- [ ] Select the plants in the tropical greenhouse

### Today Notes & ideas
The DGPS and the drone are available, we just still have to see with the botanical garden collaborators to see when we can do the mesurements.

For the lyophilisation, a night in the freezer at -80Â°C is ok and seems to work. The jar has been put in water ice during the transport to prevent melting before the transfer in the lyophilisator. one and a half hour later, it's still frozen without water in the bottom, what we didn't have with the liquid nitrogen directly.
