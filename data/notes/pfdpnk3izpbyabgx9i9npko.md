When the user arrives to this mode, he has to choose the wieghting unit. This permits to reduce the size of the number to enter if the user weights big quantities or very small quantities (*Figure 1*).

If the user wants to have a weight constraint, he has to enter it with the tolerance. With this process, the application will check if the entered weight is correct. This will avoid typing errors (*Figure 2*).

If the user has to weight very different types of samples, he can choose to deactivate weight constraint. This is useful if collected quantities are very small and the user wants to extract all the collected material (*Figure 3*).

After having entered all needed parameters, the user will have the possibility to scan field samples. Then a box will ask the weight (*Figure 4*).

When the weight is entered and valid (if constraint is activated), the user can submit the metadata to the database (*Figure 5*).
