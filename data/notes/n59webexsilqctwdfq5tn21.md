## Notes
I put the last 52 samples in the freeze dryer today, which is now running over the weekend. This means that the samples are now in the freeze dryer for 72 hours, which is very good. I am very confident that next week all samples will be completely dry. It has been shown that it is really not due to the size and thickness of the plants, but that they can really be in the freeze dryer long enough. 48h was just too short for some plants. 

Next week, Edouard will take care of the next steps for me, as I'm unfortunately not allowed to go to the lab - and then comes the mass spectrometry with Pierre-Marie. I am already very excited ðŸ˜Š
