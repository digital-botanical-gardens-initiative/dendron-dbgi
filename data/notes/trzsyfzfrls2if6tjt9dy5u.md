# Species list

For an overview of species present in the UniFr botanical garden you can have a look at the http://www.dbgi.org/dendron-jbuf/ hierarchy.


# Species selection

Possible candidates for species to select for the pilot.

## Saxifragaceae

Theofania Patsiou (Parisod group at UniFr is interested in profiling Saxifragaceae) and we have an ongoing project on metabolomics of 200 Saxifraga florulenta.
Maybe a family to think about

## Papaver 

See https://www.unifr.ch/jardin-botanique/fr/recherche/projets.html
Most likely will not be developed enough in March/May

## Baldellia

http://www.dbgi.org/dendron-jbuf/notes/2br7f2tk8zr34ed97vza7i1/

Gregor Kozlowski is still very interested in the chemical profiles of Baldellia. 

## Audrey Le Cabec

Audrey (from ICOA) should be passing some months next spring.
She will work on "chèvrefeuille, fusain et clématite." and maybe other species.
Maybe add http://www.dbgi.org/dendron-jbuf/notes/2br7f2tk8zr34ed97vza7i1/ to the list.
