### Meeting with Rostyslav and Maelle

### Summary meeting with @**Rostyslav Kuzyakiv**  and @**MaÃ«lle Wannier** 

The entity will be named `OBSERVATIONS`

In the following excel file (
[openBIS.xlsx](/user_uploads/44088/Q7hcDJugoabBw1aWUYgxagvb/openBIS.xlsx)) :

- when no `Description` value is available the value can be directly copied from the `Label` field
- when the Data Type value is `CONTROLLED VOCABULARY` it can be switched to `VARCHAR`
- when the Data Type value is `GEOMETRY` it can be switched to `TEXT`
- when the Data Type value is `?` it can be switched to `TEXT`

@**Rostyslav Kuzyakiv** will work on the pyBIS script on his side and get back to us when their is a functional version so we push observation to the openBIS instance.
