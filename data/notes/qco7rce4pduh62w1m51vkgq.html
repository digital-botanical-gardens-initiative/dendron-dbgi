<li>Call with Marco to finish up the <a href="https://github.com/earth-metabolome-initiative/emi-monorepo/tree/sirius-bindings/bindings/sirius">Sirius bindings crate</a> which is getting close to be finished. We are now working on the documentation and the tests. Specifically, it needs:
<ul class="contains-task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled> A test for the actual execution of Sirius as part of the test suite on the GitHub actions CI.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled> A richer README that explains what is the crate, and how to use it.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was looking for a way to format the <a href="https://yew.rs/docs/en/next/html/index.html"><code>html!</code> macro used in Yew</a> in a more readable way. I found that the <code>html!</code> macro is a bit hard to read when the HTML is complex. The macro can be formatted by using the Visual Studio code extension <code>https://github.com/ttax00/code-yew-server</code>. This extension allows you to format the <code>html!</code> macro in a more readable way, among several other Yew-related features.</p>
