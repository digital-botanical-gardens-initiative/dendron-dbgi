## Notes
Today I spent most of the day weighing the remaining samples. Unfortunately, the CSV list was not up to date and so I simply entered the weight here. 
It is now definitely clear that the drying of the plants has something to do with the length of the freeze-drying. Because this time the samples were in the freeze-dryer for 72 hours and all but unfortunately 2 samples were dry.
