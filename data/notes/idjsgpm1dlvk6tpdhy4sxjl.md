The use of semi-permanent UUIDs seems to be appropriate in the context of collecting tree samples for the DBGI for the length of this project. They provide a visual cue to help differentiate which organisms have been sampled and which have not. The results obtained were of similar quality when compared to previous works with the added benefit of linking extra information to a single sample. However, a test should be conducted to verify how long lasting they really are in other, harsher environments.

Systematically using UUIDs for every sampled organism shouldn't be implemented. As it is sometimes difficult to say when an orgasnism starts and when it ends, such as bamboos and other plant developping from a rhizome. The format used in this project doesn't fit mobile organisms, such as animals, and other solutions, such as using rings, microchips, DBGI code, ..., should be explored.
