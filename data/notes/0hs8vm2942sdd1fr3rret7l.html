<p>The original species name (from the UniFR Botanical Gardens) is not always recognized by iNat.</p>
<p>See for example <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/201737900">https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/201737900</a></p>
<p>We will need to establish a system to proceed to the eventual curation of these names and feedback this information to the botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Pyrrosia niphoboloides</p>
<p>Apparently according to it is the accepted name <a href="https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/taxon/BCH9H">https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/taxon/BCH9H</a></p>
<p>We check for the presence of the indicated synonyms on iNat</p>
<ul>
<li>Drymoglossum niphoboloides</li>
<li>Taenitis niphoboloides</li>
</ul>
<p>We stumble upon the <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/help#:~:text=If%20a%20species%20or%20other,names%2C%20old%20scientific%20names">https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/help#:~:text=If%20a%20species%20or%20other,names%2C%20old%20scientific%20names</a>). </p>
<p>For now we will thus follow </p>

<p>Why doesn't iNaturalist recognize the name I've entered?
iNaturalist has name information for many different kinds of organisms and continues to add new species names to our database. If we do not recognize a particular name you have entered, it's possible it is an outdated synonym or that it is simply missing from the database.</p>
<p>If a species or other taxon is missing from the iNaturalist database, first try clicking the "Search external name providers" link that appears after you search for a name and get no results. You can also try alternative names that we might recognize (common names, old scientific names).</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, add the original name to the description or as a comment and save it. Then:</p>
<p>Search for your taxon's parent taxon in the header search on our website. For example, if I want to want to add Crotalus exampleus to iNaturalist, I would search for Crotalus in the search box and click "About" next to it.
This will take you to the taxon's page. Click on the Curation menu (under the graphs on the right) and select "Flag for Curation".
Write a short note about the taxon you would like to add and please link to a source. If you have a lot of information you think is important, or a large body of text, please put it in the comments of your newly created flag, rather than adding it to the reason for flagging. Our site curators will see it and take a look as soon as possible.</p>
