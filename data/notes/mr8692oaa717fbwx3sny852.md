Agenda **Wednesday 12 July 2023**


Starting at 9:30 

- Physical at Pavillon Vert. See here for location details https://www.unifr.ch/scimed/fr/pavillonvert
- Remote at https://meet.jit.si/DBGI_talks


# Welcome and workshop membersâ€™ introduction (15 min)

# EMI and DBGI presentation + overview of current chemodiversity description approaches (45 min)

The objective here will be to understand what are the main ways to characterize chemodiversity from complex biological matrices (at least the ones used in EMI).
This overview will recap which objects are handled in natural products research and computational mass spec and how they are generated.
This recap should allow us to start on the same page when working on the semantic model.

# Coffee break

# Define the main purposes of the Earth Metabolome semantic model (15 min)

    - What do we have in hands ? Review of the current ENPKG model https://enpkg.commons-lab.org/doc/index.html and Fig S1 in https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-sljbt

    Eg.: structure existing data, Swiss Botanical Garden use case

# Review: ontology engineering activities (rest of the morning)

- Organism taxonomy 
- Natural Product Taxonomy (with [SKOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Knowledge_Organization_System "Simple Knowledge Organization System \(SKOS\) is a W3C recommendation designed for representation of thesauri, classification schemes, taxonomies, subject-heading systems, or any other type of structured controlled vocabulary. SKOS is part of the Semantic Web family of standards built upon RDF and RDFS, and its main objective is to enable easy publication and use of such vocabularies as linked data.") - NPClassifier)
- MS2 spectrum and LCMS analysis

# Lunch (12:30?)

# Review: ontology engineering activities (afternoon)

 - Spectrum annotation
 - Chemical structure representation
 - Coffee break (10 min)
 - Laboratory object description
 - Metadata for provenance (e.g, Prov-O)
 - Links / cross-references ? To which resources?

See [Supporting Sustainability of Chemistry by Linking Research Data with Physically Preserved Research Materials](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/64a2fa0cba3e99daef73fa6a/original/supporting-sustainability-of-chemistry-by-linking-research-data-with-physically-preserved-research-materials.pdf)
Maybe would it also worth having a look at [[Methodology.metadata]] ressources such as the CEDAR workbench.

# Final remarks and next steps
