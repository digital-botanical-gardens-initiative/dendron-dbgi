<p>We have set up 2 upcoming meetings  (more targeted than today's)
Anyone is welcome to join them. And also envisioned starting a small taskgroup.</p>
<ul>
<li>one small working group on legal and ethics aspects of sample collection (Anne Laure in JBN) Daniel is interested in ethics aspects and will possibly participate.</li>
<li>one workshop on opneBIS (Henry, Caterina)</li>
<li>one wikibase workshop (Daniel) In CH end of March 29-30 possibly few days earlier maybe in person.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last notes by Daniel. He is involved in Soil for Europe (intersect with DBGI)
PhenOps phenotypic observation, citizen science observation Botanical Gardens and citizen gardens
They gather temp data.</p>
<p>Found back previous email of Daniel on these projects </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am involved with the EU Project "Soils for Europe" <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101091115">https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101091115</a> that may be of interest to you,
and I talked to two projects here in Germany that I think would be good to connect with in some way, e.g. in terms of their model beddings and citizen involvement:
"Pflanze KlimaSchutz" <a href="https://www.pflanzeklimakultur.de/index.php/de/">https://www.pflanzeklimakultur.de/index.php/de/</a>
"PhenObs" <a href="https://www.idiv.de/en/phenobs.html">https://www.idiv.de/en/phenobs.html</a>
Both involve collaborations between botanical gardens, with the first focusing on citizen science and public engagement in four German cities (Jena, Halle, Leipzig, Berlin), while the latter is more international (including Davos, whose Fabian Reppel will give a talk here in about an hour - [1]).</p>
<p>I also would like us to think about
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Wiki_Loves_Plants">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Wiki_Loves_Plants</a>
and similar initiatives involving iNaturalist and Wikimedia.
For instance, I would like to explore infrared imaging to highlight thermogenic plants.</p>
