<p>If you are new into the DBGI and EMI projects and you want to collect samples, here is the tutorial to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go <a href="https://emi-collection.unifr.ch/accounts/signup/">there</a> to create an account on the collection server. An error will occur, but your account have been registered. You won't need to use this webpage again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate the username of you newly created account and the specific project you want to join (JBN, JBUF, EMI, ...) to Edouard Br√ºlhart (<a href="/dendron-dbgi/mailto:edouard.bruelhart@unifr.ch">edouard.bruelhart@unifr.ch</a>). Wait the adding (manual so it can take some hours/days).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you are part of the project you chose. Following your needs, you can create your own layer by following this <a href="https://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi/notes/qug423ond4xtns8lelu38p2/">tutorial</a>. If you already have a layer to collect, you can follow this <a href="https://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi/notes/fkbclzsoo3zgkkvgrlsg26g/">tutorial</a> to begin the collection process.</p>
