<h3 id="review-collecte">Review collecte<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#review-collecte"></a></h3>
<p>The collection went well, the weather wasn't too bad, but a little too cold for finding insects easily. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Methode 1 : 20x20 crushed
This methode was applied in all 8 plots without any difficulty. But the equipment was unsuitable and needs to be reviewed for the next collection. First problem : the label didnt stick well, two of them lost it in the nitrogen box. fibl_000084 and filb_000081 are possibly mixed, even if we attributed the label back based on the diversity of plants inside the zip-lock. Second problem :  Zip-locks are too fagile and disintegrate in liquid nitrogen. We nedd to find some more solide zip-lock, or boxes that we can put in the liquide nitrogen. </p>
</li>

<p>Methode 2 : mesofauna extraction
Extracor berlese is running, we have done the 2 first extraction on the weekend right after the collecte (D+1). Some worms, ents, and other could be extracted. But, for the second extraction, the soil seems to be deteriorating in the fridge, with traces of mould on plant remains. Several earthworms already dead. We are waiting to see if we still can extracted some mesofauna. Probably the 3th and 4th will be even more deteriorating. The technique is working but we need to have one set up for each and do the extraction quite quick after the collect. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Methode 3 : 1x1m plantes extractions
This methode were not applied in the field. Taking all the plant in a 1 per 1 meter square would have taken too much time during the collection. It was not suitable for this collect. Instead we have lookes for paires of plantes that we can find in the conventional and the biodynamic plot to compare them. We could find some potatoes (last year crop) in each plot, as well as some grasses. We also collected some random plants and other (insect, gasteropod) to add them at the database. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Methode 4 : soil extraction
This methode was applied correctly in each plot. We are waiting to see how the extraction can go. </p>
