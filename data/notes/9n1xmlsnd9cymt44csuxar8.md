This is Disha's DBGI daily open-notebook.

 

## Doing
1. #VKG modify TRY-db csv file to include 1 column explaining the data type (one of the folloiwng three values): continuous-trait, discrete-trait, non-trait to distinguish between quuantitative & non-quanititattive trait and non trait data
2. #VKG segregating information into only necessary columns in GLOBI interaction data (92 columns at the moment, not all are useful) and map it to the existing try-db database.


## Done  
1. #VKG extracting relevant records from GLOBI interactions
2. Managed to get a UniNe computer and setup remote desktop client.


## Todo tomorrow or soon

1. #VKG Now that more RAM/disc-space available on galileo, I will transfer full TRY-db 7 gb database and work with the full version. Test SPARQL queries. To be done until two weeks from now.
2. #SciComm Philipp gave contacts for people who can help with making videos.
