<p>Today Edouard, Stephanie and I picked up the samples from the freezer that we had frozen on 23.02.2023 until the dry freezer is free. There was a small problem because the adhesive labels with the QR-Code had come off. Luckily it wasn't too bad as they were still attached to the tubes and we fixed them with glue.
We filled the samples in the box with liquid nitrogen and then put them in the dry freezer. Which are now in there for 48 hours. </p>
<p>It is very important to book/reserve the dry freezer because there is only one and it is well used. If it is not immediately available, which is usually the case, you have to freeze the samples as we did last week. until the dry freezer becomes available. </p>
<p>I already had a login at iNaturalist and so we "only" had to import, sort and label the pictures from last week. The grouped pictures: label them in the field with emi_external_id: and insert the corresponding number, e.g. dbgi_000922. Add the name of the plant, e.g. Pachyphytum oviferum J.A. Purpus. Then mark the location with latitude: 46.7930712769837 and longitude: 7.15577631011612 and submit all finished images to iNaturalist.</p>
