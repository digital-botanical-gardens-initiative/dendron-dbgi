# Assembling humble bundles of samples


This project was conducted by Simon Rérat, under the supervision of Pierre-Marie Allard and Edouard Brülhart.

It revolved around the implementation of individual organism tracking through the use of Universally Unique IDentifiers (UUIDs), the sampling of different plant organs coming from a single individual, and the sampling of trees in the Jardin Botanique de l'Université de Fribourg (JBUF).

The motivation behind the introduction of the UUIDs was the possibility of differentiating the origin of samples by giving a proper individuality to sampled individuals. This could allow for a finer analysis of the collected data. People with different eye color do not have the same metabolomic content in their eye. It is the same with plants and their organs.

The use of UUIDs seems to be appropriate in the context of the Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DBGI). Results of quality similar to previous student's projects have been acquired, with the added benefit of extra information linked to a single sample.

Therefore, UUIDs will continue to be used in the near future.
