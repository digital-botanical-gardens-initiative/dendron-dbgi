I am trying to store the pictures on an external cloud storage. So that the QFieldcloud projects are only composed of maps and layers, and the pictures are stored in a different instance. But before the transfer, I want to change pictures coordinates so that they match the location of the added point. In addition, I want to do an automatic quality check, to compress pictures that exceeds the 20MB size, so that the iNaturalist import can be done.
