I'm trying to find an alternative to QField as it is no more free to use. Here I found a project that seems really cool: http://www.openmapkit.org/. I'll try it to define if it is adapted to our needs.

Badly http://www.openmapkit.org/ is deprecated. however, https://getodk.org/ seems to be really good. There are no IOS application, but we can use a webapp. On android an application is available.

I found that I can host a version of QField Cloud, so that we would have the same setup as now, but with self-hosted data.
