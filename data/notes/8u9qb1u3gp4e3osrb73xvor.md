Nature and Biodiversity
The specific objectives of the sub-programme ‘Nature and Biodiversity’ are the
following:
− to develop, demonstrate, promote and stimulate scale up of innovative
techniques, methods and approaches (including nature-based solutions and
ecosystem approach) for reaching the objectives of the EU legislation and
policy on nature and biodiversity, and to contribute to the knowledge base and
to the application of best practices, including through the support of the
Natura 2000
− to support the development, implementation, monitoring and enforcement of
EU legislation and policy on nature and biodiversity, including by improving
governance at all levels, in particular through enhancing capacities of public
and private actors and the involvement of civil society, also taking into due
consideration the possible contributions provided by citizen science
− to catalyse the large-scale deployment of successful solutions/approaches for
implementing EU legislation and policy on nature and biodiversity, by
replicating results, integrating related objectives into other policies and into
public and private sector practices, mobilising investment and improving
access to finance.
