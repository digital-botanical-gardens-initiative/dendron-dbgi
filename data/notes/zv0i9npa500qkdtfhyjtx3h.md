# This is Luca Cappelletti's DBGI daily open-notebook.

Today is 2024.02.13

## Done

- Worked more on tables
- Call with Pierre and Marco discussing the sirius-bindings crate
- Finalized the sirius-bindings crate and published it
- Started to transform tables into proper Rust structs

## Today I learned that

- Teams exist on GitHub
- You can assign ownership of a crate to a team by using the `cargo owner github:{organization}:{team}` command within the repo directory
- To remove a conda environment you can use `conda remove --name {env_name} --all` and they also suggest to run `conda clean --all --yes` to clean up the cache which may be taking up a lot of space
