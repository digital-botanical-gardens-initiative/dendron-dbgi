### What do we have ?

#### Physical objects

    - living specimens (look trough the window !)
    - dried tissues collections (bring Tubes)
    - extracts (Tubes)
    - fridges
#### Digital objects

    - Species list. We had a quick talk with https://botalista.community/ people.
    - iNat. The DBGI iNat project https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative
  We cant use the iNat API (because we have non-research grade observation - cultivated specimens)

  See examples of DBGI iNat entries curated by others : 


- https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/139418418
- https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/139418397
- https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/139418389

Think of a way to capture these community curated entries and forward then to the implicated botanical gardens.


    - Directus (http://directus.dbgi.org/) Have a quick tour.
    - MassIVE (several set uploaded e.g. https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=bd2a519b678e4f92aeca6434166ea548, https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=589f0793f15d4b87aebd699900ad468e)
    For long term consider other MasSpec repositories. (Metabolights https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/) Others ?


    - Physical samples tracking: none at the moment.

### What do we want ?

#### Physical objects

    - living specimens (look trough the window) - Could this improve ? How ?
    - dried tissues collections (Falcon Tubes) - Could this improve ? How ?
    - extracts (Tubes) - Could this improve ? How ?
    - fridges () - Could this improve ? How ?

#### Digital objects

    - Species list
    - iNat
    - Directus
    - MassIVE. Are they new developments /recommendations on this side ? GNPS2 ?
    - Physical samples tracking

Frictionless Software toolkit (https://frictionlessdata.io/)
Bioregistry (https://bioregistry.io/) (Also in WP3)

If we take the directus example, it is hosted on a computer of the COMMONS Lab at UniFr and can only be accessed through the UniFr VPN.
Should we buy / rent another machine to ease external access ?
If so where ? Which specifications ?


## OpenBIS

A workshop is to be planned in the next month. In the first 15 days of March. Doodle to be send by Henry and Caterina
Physical / remote
Half a day to get started.
Objectives : 
- get familiar with openBIS (https://openbis.ch/)
- Fill in the empty openBIS templates


OpenBIS instance could be hosted on switchengines (https://www.switch.ch/engines/)
For around 1000$/year 
Docker image existing.

Possibilities of lightweight implementation ? Is this really necessary ?!
