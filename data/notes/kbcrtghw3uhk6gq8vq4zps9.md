Submission deadline:17.09.2024
The Agora scheme aims to foster dialogue between scientists and society. It encourages researchers to communicate their current research to an audience of lay people. Agora projects have to initiate a direct dialogue between researchers and the public in which they interact and listen to each other.

Projects with a budget of up to CHF 200,000 (Agora projects) need to be submitted by the Agora submission deadline at 17:00 CET, set annually. Funding decisions are communicated in Spring the following year (within approx. 6 months).

It is possible to make Lifelist on inat
See for example nshwab's unobserved fungis of Switzerland.
It would be interesting to have a list of all the species that are not yet profiled in the frame of the Earth Metabolome Initiative.
