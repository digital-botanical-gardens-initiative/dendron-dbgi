## Paused

## Done

## Notes
Unfortunately, that was not it. The whole process is delayed for various reasons. I still have to take some pictures manually and add them to iNaturalist because they have disappeared. Then some samples are still missing. Edouard has little time and will probably not be able to do the rest of the extraction until the end of the week and when Pierre-Marie will be able to do the injection is also not quite clear. 
Now for my bachelor thesis I will just write what I have done. Since it has to be finished in exactly 3 weeks. So I should have all the data this week to write and do something about it. 
It's all very strict for me right now, so I'm trying not to overdo it and just work with what I have. That means: I describe the project and my part in it for the Bachelor's thesis. And of course what exactly I did, etc.

## Todo tomorrow
