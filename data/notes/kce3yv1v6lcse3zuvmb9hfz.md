Looking into https://github.com/MicheleCotrufo/pdf2doi

And https://github.com/MicheleCotrufo/pdf2bib

pdf2bib is working smoothly.
Ask Donat if they can handle bibtex file rather than the gdocs


- Ask IT if possible to open UniFR VPN to external email account


Adriano will give Patrick the set of papers curated manually and the LOTUS outputs (filtered for the one already present in PMC)

Apparently it would be possible to ask for a UniFR access 
see https://my.unifr.ch/group/res/compte-pour-externes



## Paused

https://www.printables.com/model/424604-thermo-scientific-vanquish-autosampler-trayfreezer

Could be useful for stock of samples in freezer and injection on the Vanquish.
Removes the step of getting out each of the samples and replacing in the trays.
