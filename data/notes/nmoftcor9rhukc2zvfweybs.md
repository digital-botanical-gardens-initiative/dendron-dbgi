# Meeting with Cyril from botalista

We discussed with Cyril and the query to select all collection from BGs will be implemented. He just has to contact is colleague that manages Botavista and will transmit us an implementation delay. So all seems good from this part. For now, we will test the implementation on JBUF, but once done we could apply this to JBN if they allow public access to data.
