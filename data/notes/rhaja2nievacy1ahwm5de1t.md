### Ontology 
An ontology is a formal specification of concepts, from a particular domain of knowledge, that are arranged in a hierarchy, as a directed acyclic graph, where concepts are defined in relation to other concepts in the graph. 

### KG 
A knowledge graph (KG) is a graph that represents knowledge where entities are represented as nodes and relationships between these entities are represented as edges.

Graph formalisms:
- Property graphs
- RDF graphs


We allready had this discussion. Apparently Neo4j is a property graph.
Which type of graph formalism are we looking for EMIKG ?


KGs are useful for graph-based machine learning
- Edge prediction
- Node classification



### Biolink model

Created [[biolink-model]]

Biolink model adopted in frame of the NCATS project.


- A high-level data model for representing biological and biomedical knowledge
- Bridges multiple vocabularies and ontologies
- Agnostic to the graph formalism used to represent knowledge
- The model consists of:
    * Entities
    * Associations
    * Predicates
    * Properties
