    - HTML
- [ ] Try small dashboards with LOTUS data

## CODE

## NOTES

### Python dashboard
https://dash.plotly.com/

=> seems to be the best for dashboards
  - Possibility of using package such as molplotly for chemical visualization
  - still can add css/js/... to enhance the dashboard (https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-to-embed-bootstrap-css-js-in-your-python-dash-app-8d95fc9e599e)

### molplotly
=> tried it                                                 
Doesn't display the molecules... Even with the example csv given on https://github.com/wjm41/molplotly         
Maybe very slow?


### Features needed for the vizualisation project
- Plots interacting with each other (*datawarrior*) => https://dash.plotly.com/interactive-graphing (Update Graphs on Hover)
- 'contains' ... (*datawarrior*)
- Search by structure (*datawarrior*)
- Check for similarity (*datawarrior*)
- phylogeny by MASST (*https://masst.gnps2.org/microbemasst/*) (*NP classifier*)
