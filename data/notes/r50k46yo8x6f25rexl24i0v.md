This is Disha's DBGI daily open-notebook.

 
Work update from May-June

## Doing
1. #SciComm In talks with Manuela Dahinden to shape the AGORA grant. Meeting on 17th May with Manuela, Emmanuel and Pierr-Marie.
2. Start Intro for the paper.
3. To do still:
4. Started writing the AGORA grant (Project description - Context).

## Done
1. #VKG modified TRY-db csv file to include 1 column explaining the data type (one of the folloiwng three values): continuous-trait, discrete-trait, non-trait to distinguish between quuantitative & non-quanititattive trait and non trait data
2. #VKG ontop-materialized the vkg (try-db, globi, traits, enpkg). python rdflib used for 'graphfying' and run SPARQL queries (See github repo: https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/integrate_trydb_globi_enpkg)



## Todo tomorrow or soon

1.For #VKG
a) Run queries with only plants from ENPKG. Think abut what the user wants. 

b) Similarity matrices for traits: scaling followed by euclidean and bray-curtis. how about mixing them (take avg) and then plot node distance based on the avg distance, different edge coloring/width by distance specific to a metric.

c) human-plant interaction. Is there a database which lists plants edible?

d) Manu will provide climate change data from GBIF or from GIFT.

2. #SciComm Build a graphical overview of the two ideas discussed with Manuela.
3. Start writing Introduction and Methods for the paper.

## Today I learned that

## Paused

9. Profile article for the DBGI website. 
10. DISPEL conversation.
11. Looked at PheObs, AusTraits and Globi. AusTraits looks very promising. Have to see how they integrated data.
