# This is Edouard's DBGI daily open-notebook.

Today is 2022.12.24

# To do

- Relabel the falcon with the bigger labels

- Try to host correctly the dbgi maps with geoserver

- Prepare the inserts for the mass spec analysis

- Optimize the communication between QGIS and iNaturalist

# done

I finally succeeded to publish the map with geoserver in WMS format. However, I didn't find yet how to make it available for all. For now, I can only see the map with the computer that hosts the map. In addition, I didn't find how to publish the map directly on dendron. For now, it has to pass via a link, that is not so good. It would be better to directly have the map on dendron.
