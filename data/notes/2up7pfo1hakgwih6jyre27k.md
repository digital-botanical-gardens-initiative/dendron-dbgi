First lets check the last discussions on the forum https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/forum/discussions

### Today's Todo 

- [ ] Make the drone flight
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

### Today Notes & ideas
The flight is done and the GPS points have been collected and transformed like followed : The raw format was in MN03(CH1903). They have been changed in MN95(CH1903+) format, that is the actual for switzerland. After that, the data have been transformed to have less digits as possible (Xc = X - 2578300, Yc = Y - 1182200, Zc = Z - 632). For now I don't have the drone photos yet. I'll ask them tomorrow morning.
