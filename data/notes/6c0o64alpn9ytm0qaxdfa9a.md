QFieldCloud is our collection server. It permits to make the link between [[Master-Works.Edouard-Brülhart.Services.QGIS]], the computer application, and [[Master-Works.Edouard-Brülhart.Services.QField]], the field application. It also permits to collect data simultaneously on multiple devices.

You can find the scripts we use to deploy it as a self-hosted instance [here](https://github.com/opengisch/qfieldcloud).
