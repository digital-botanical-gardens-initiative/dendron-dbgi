But it is taking a lot of time to get this done. So, I decided to use databricks community edition to run simple workflows which require upto 15GB RAM (<a href="https://community.cloud.databricks.com/">https://community.cloud.databricks.com/</a>). I made an account, now working on technical aspects to make R and bash scripts work.</li>

We did some brainstorming around how best to proceed with the AGORA project. Important points discussed:
a) Two main ideas: Make a video of informal interviews with researchers and PI who are deeply involved in this project, Design a SciComm project around data literacy (a topic rarely touched upon while comunicating with general public from non-Science background)
b) Combination of both digital and physical components. e.g: A screen-panel with virtual safaris, where people can click a location on a word map and see what plants exist where, maybe try to convert this into a game with a reward.
Note: Idea not discussed with Manuela: Virtual exhibition using <a href="https://v21artspace.com/virtual-exhibitions">https://v21artspace.com/virtual-exhibitions</a> or <a href="https://www.artsteps.com/">https://www.artsteps.com/</a>
c) Fund-raising and SciComm are different projects. Try not to mix them.
d) Apply for the big grant with a deadline in Sept rather than the rolling call. Set aside salary % (upto 40%) for Science communication expert.
e) Check eligibility to appy for AGORA : citizenship criteria, research employment criteria (if I can show an employment contract with salary covered for the period of the employment, I can apply for AGORA individually, otherwise I can ask Emmanuel to apply).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I talked to Emmanuel about this and we discussed the following:
a) He will contact directors of botanical garden in Neuchatel  if they would like to have a panel with virtual components.
b) Making a video is a good idea. I will contact a professional to help us with that.
c) Data literacy sounds great, but the implementation is tricky and needs efforts. </p>
