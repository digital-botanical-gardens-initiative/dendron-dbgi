<p>Natural products (NPs) encompass the ensemble of metabolites produced by living organisms. These molecules can belong to a core metabolism shared among most organisms and fundamental to proper cell functioning (e.g. DNA nucleobases). A much more structurally diverse set of molecules, specialized metabolites have been shaped by evolution and represent the common language of Nature. They act as chemical mediators, facilitating complex interactions between species within ecosystems. NPs are endowed with intricate chemical structures and potent biological activities. They thus have long played a central role in human civilization, as sources of food and particularly medicines. Plants and other natural sources of chemicals represent the basis of traditional medicine, which is the main form of healthcare available to most of the worldâ€™s population. </p>
