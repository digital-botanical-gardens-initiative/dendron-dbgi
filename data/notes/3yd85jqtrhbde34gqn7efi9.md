## Notes
Unfortunately, even after the second run in the freeze dryer, one sample was not dry. I cannot explain why. There were also samples with plants that were much thicker and larger. Today I took a new sample in the greenhouse and froze it. Afterwards I can put it straight into the freeze dryer. 

Further problems:
28 of the collected samples from 5/6 April ei those are missing the pictures. They got lost during synchronisation. According to Edouard, it is no longer possible to restore them. Now I have to take the photos again (28 x 5 = 140 photos). The problem is that first all the other photos have to be uploaded to iNaturalist so that we can find out which 28 plants are missing. Since Edouard is working on automating the whole thing on iNaturalist, it will take a while. Of course, all this is holding up my progress and also the one sample that I unfortunately had to take again. 
I still hope that all the pictures will be at iNaturalist by the beginning of next week at the latest, that Edouard will have done all the extractions and that Pierre-Marie will have done the injections by the end of next week at the latest. 
I am getting very nervous. I want to have the evaluations so that I can work with them for my paper and presentation on 31 May and finish everything.
