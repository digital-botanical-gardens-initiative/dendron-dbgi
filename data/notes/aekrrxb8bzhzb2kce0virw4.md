# This is Audrey's DBGI report 

## Context of the internship 
 
The analytical team of the Institute of Organic and Analytical Chemistry (ICOA) of the University of Orléans is specialized in the characterization of plant extract and the determination of their bioactivity. Ornamental plants are highly produced in the Région Centre Val-de-Loire (France) being able to characterized and identify bioactive could lead to new way of valorisation of this large quantity of raw materials.

To discover the potential of ornamental plant, a metabolomic study is undertaken. In this study we are interested in 3 genera of ornamental plants. The CDHRC (Comité de Développement Horticol Région Centre) produce 2 _Clematis_ spp, 1 _Lonicera_ sp and 1 _Euonymus_ sp and to extend our study to several species a collaboration with the DBGI (Digital Botanical Garden Initiative) had been established.
The objective of this collaboration is to acquire news skills in metabolomic treatment, to access to several species of _Clematis_, _Lonicera_ and _Euonymus_ to the study and integrate this result to the DBGI dataset.
 

## Methodology

### Collaborative tools 
The DBGI is an Open Science project, this ambition had lead the contributors to set up differents tools : 

1. **Visual Studio Code** : Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages. 

2. **Open notebook** : An open daily notebook of each contributors of the project can be submitted to the DBGI dendron (http://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi/). 

3.  **Git Hub** : GitHub, Inc. is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. Repositories, containing documents, scripts or tutorials can be easily shared thanks to Git (https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative) 

The used of this tools had required the learning of basics skills of navigating via a control terminal 
 
| General command  | use |
|-------------------|
| `cd` | access to a folder | 
| `mkdir` | create new folder | 
| `cd ..` | come back one folder before |
| `tree` | show the tree structure |
| `ls` | know the file or folder present |

 ##
 
Specific to git | use 
|---------------------|
`git clone` + https url | clone the repository in local folder 
`git pull` | actualise the local folder from git 
`git add` | add one or several file to the repository 
`git commit -m` "exemple" | commit the new modification to git commit
`git push` | push last modifications to actualise the git 
git status | 

##

Specific to the Open Notebook (in VS code) | use
|-------------|--------------|
ctrl+o+n | create a daily notebook  

### Wetlab  
A specific workflow for the organization of the wetlab part had been set up. The workflow required the used of the following software or application : directus, Avery, Qfield and Inaturalist. The global workflow is avaibable on the [link](https://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi/notes/vrl2ey4vuvmomo8zj14wx6u/) 

### Metabolomics datatreatment 
A specific workflow for the datatreatment of DBGI plant had been set up. The workflow required the used of the following software, application or git : MS convert, Inaturalist, GNPS, Mzmine 2.3, Sirius, Cytoscape, Met_annot_enhancer 

The uses of the differents software required a higher calculation capacity than the personnal laptop used. An ssh connection had been establised between the servor and the computer in order to launch session, interfaced with Xpra, to run mzmine or sirius. 
The global workflow of datatreatment is available **here**


## Results ##

### Plant collections

DBGI collection : 16 _Clematis_, 16 _Lonicera_, and 4 _Euonymus_ had been collected between Botanical Garden of Fribourg and Botanical Garden of Neuchatel. 
CDHRC collection : 2 _Clematis_, 1 _Lonicera_ and 1_Euonymus had beed collected.
