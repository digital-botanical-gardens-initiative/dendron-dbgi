Now messing up with the w3id for URL redirection.

See here for a comparison between PURLS and w3id:

## Notes


I created the https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org/pull/5094/commits/b14d8ab269f9f599ce10ce9d41775820ce1ab853 mostly for testing purposes.

I will now proceed to create the emi, dbgi and commons-lab w3id redirects.
