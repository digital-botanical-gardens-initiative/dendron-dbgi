## EMI:

The goal of the Earth Metabolome Initiatve (EMI) is similar in scale to the Earth Biogenome Project. Yet instead of gene diversity, it takes an interest in chemical diversity (chemiodiversity). Its goal is simple, yet ambitious: Document all of the chemical diversity (chimiodiversity) of all known living organisms, while anthropogenic biodiversity loss is speeding up.
In term, this should benefit  human society as a whole, help better understand the chemical fundations of the biosphere, and provide molecular arguments in favor of the protection of biodiversity.

It strives for the creation of a new web of knowledge, linking metabolomics, biology, chemistry, and other open datasets together.
To reach this goal, the EMI team will have to develop  informatical, organisational, and scientific tools tailor made for their needs.
This is where the Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DBGI) comes into place (The EMI Consortium, 2022).


## DBGI:

The Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DBGI) is designed as a pilot for the EMI. It has a central role to play in it as its goals are to design, automate, and optimize the workflow leading to metabolomic analysis, while having acces to a species rich, easily accessible, somewhat controlled environment (i.e. botanical gardens).

Its main goal is the collect, management, and sharing of digital informations acquired in living botanical collections. As well as the management of physical libraries (?)
 To do so, it focuses on large scale characterisation of the chemiodiverstiy of plants through mass spectrometric approaches.
Not to forget the creation of a knowledge graphe by recouping the informations from many databases (such as Botalista, Open tree of life (Rutz et al. 2022), LOTUS (Rutz et al. 2019), ...) to organise, structure and connect them all.
As the methods of the DBGI while be applied to the EMI, its methods and workflow need to be scalable to match the scale of such an ambitious project. And ultimately, be applicable in wild, hard to access ecosystems.
This should help visualise and search the functioning of ecosystems, orient research and conservation efforts.

As of now, only the Jardin Botanique de l'Université de Fribourg (JBUF) and the Jardin Botanique de Neuchâtel (JBN) are part of the initiative. The causes being practical, founding teams have their offices located in Fribourg and Neuchâtel respectively, and ther unique characteristics, the JBUF arranged the System according to the APG IV (UNIFR about JBUF), and the JBN has a plants collection of ethnomedicinal value (The DBGI Consortium, 2022).

## Definition of tree

Defining what a tree is might seem childish at first glance. However, this simple question is all the more relevant as many definitions exist (Lund, 2015), but none seem to be universally agreed upon in botany (Hallé, 2008).

Phylogeny leaves us somewhat clueless to what a tree is, as tree-like growth forms appeared indepentently many time through Life's long history. Indeed, lycopods, ferns, sphenopsids, gymnosperms and a few families of angiosperms, such as palms, _Dracaena_, _Fagaceae_, _Malvaceae_, ... (John, Peter, 2007) all came up with their own version of what we would today call a tree. The first modern tree, _Archaeopteris_ appeared during the Devonian period forming large forests. It lived through the Carboniferous aswell, where it formed massiv forests along _Equisetaceae_ (cursive?) of the family _Lepidondendron_ (Fairon-Demaret, 1986). Still observable to this day, the tree ferns (_Cyatheales_) are also a good exemple of non-spermatophytes arborescent growth forms.

The JBUF has been using sigils provided in the "Zander. Handwörterbuch der Pflanzennamen", a horticultural dictionnary, as a taxonomic basis. In horticulture, a tree is often described as a plant producing a lignified trunk and reaching a minimum of 4 meters in height in its adult stage. 
(Add list of sigil to show)

A more scientific way of describing what a tree is would be to use the 8 basic families of the Raunkier system in order to separate the different forms of plants. (insert image of the raunkier system). In our case, all the trees would fall into the category of the phanerophytes. However, this category doesn't allow to differentiate between bush, shrubs, and trees. This, in itself is a big enough problem. The Raunkier system is based on the location of the plant's growth-point during seasons providing adverse conditions, such as cold, and dry seasons. Thus excluding plants living in environment presenting only good seasons, i.e. tropical plants.
As the EMI is a project of international scope, the Raunkier system doesn't seem to provide a relevant definition.
Furthermore, it defines the lignification of the trunk as a necessary criteria for being a tree and the presence of a single trunk. This doesn't include many arborescent growth forms people would consider trees such as the banana tree, thuja, or the papaya tree.


In this regard, the definition of Francis Hallé seems more suited to the international ideal of the EMI as it doesn't go against the personal intuition of what a tree is, independently of time and space.
It reads as follow: 
«Un arbre est une plante habituellement pérenne possédant un ou plusieurs tronc à croissance verticale. Son anatomie rend le tronc autoportant et lui permet d'élever au-dessus des plantes voisines, concurrentes pour la lumière, une cime, ou couronne qui selon les espèces peut avoir trois constitutions différentes: 
    De grandes feuilles si l'arbre n'a pas de branches;
    Des branches qui assurent la photosynthèse si les feuilles sont trop petite pour assurer cette fonction ou absentes;
    Des branches feuillées dans le cas général.
Enfin, l’arbre est un «grand» végétal. Sa hauteur, le diamètre de son tronc, sa longévité sont évalués au regard des dimensions et de la durée de vie de l’être humain.» (Hallé, 2008)

Which could be roughly translated as :
«A tree is a generally perennial plant possessing one or more trunk growing vertically. Its anatomy makes the trunk self-supporting, allowing to rise above its neighbours, competitors for light, a summit, or crown, which, can have three different constitutions depending on the species:
        Large leaves if the tree doesn't have any branches;
        Branches ensuring photosynthesis if the leaves are to small to ensure this function, or absent;
        Leafed branches in most cases.
Finally, a tree is a «large» plant. Its height, the diameter of its trunk, its lifespan are evaluated taking human beings as a reference.» 

In short, a tree is a rather large plant, when compared to human standards, which  grows a self-supporting trunk.

## iNaturalist ?
All pictures taken while sampling are periodically uploaded on the iNaturalist website on the [DBGI profile](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative). This allows to confirm the belonging of a sampled individual to a certain species by external experts. 

This tool is crucial for the DBGI,but mostly for the EMI due to their sheer scale. The quantity of organisms to sample is significant. Therefore, specialist working on all branches of the tree of life are needed to reach the EMI's goal. Using iNaturalist allows to save up ressources by having a preformed channel of access to them.
