This Bachelor project's takes place in the context of the Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DBGI). It focuses on trees and testing the implementation of Universally Unique IDentifiers (UUIDs) in the workflow developped by previous bachelor students. Furthermore, this tool could allow to link multiple samples to an individual instead of to a species. 

In term, this could allow to increase the quantity of metadata attached to a single sample and have a better vision of the dynamics taking place in plant metabolism.
