### Publishing a crate

Publishing
- Ensure metadata in `Cargo.toml` is complete (description, license, repository, readme, categories, keywords). This repo includes them already.
- Make sure the package does not ship large datasets â€” this crate restricts the package contents via `include` to only source files and docs.
- Create a crates.io account and get an API token.
  - `cargo login <your-token>`
- Dry-run to validate the package:
  - `cargo publish --dry-run`
- Publish:
  - `cargo publish`
- Tag a release on GitHub (optional but recommended):
  - `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "colonizer v0.1.0" && git push --tags`

License
- Dual-licensed under MIT or Apache-2.0.
- You may choose either license when using this work.
