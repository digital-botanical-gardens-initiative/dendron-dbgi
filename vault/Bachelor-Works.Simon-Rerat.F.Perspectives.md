The use of UUIDs seems to be appropriate for the DBGI. However, they have only been used to bundle samples of different organs together. Other projects such as monitoring the metabolome of individuals through time, or comparing the metabolomic content of different populations could allow to make use of the other caracteristics of the UUIDs while checking if it fits in the DBGI workflow.
The sampling of the JBUF has to go on. However, we have yet to decide if we want to carry on with collecting only leaves or if we want to collect additionnal organs.
