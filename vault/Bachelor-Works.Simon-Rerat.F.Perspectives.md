The entire potential of the UUIDs hasn't been fully tapped in and other caracteristics of this tool can still be used for the development of the DBGI. Other projects such as monitoring the metabolome of individuals through time, or comparing the metabolomic content of different populations could allow to make use of other caracteristics of the UUIDs while checking if it fits in the DBGI workflow.
The sampling of the JBUF has to go on. 
A further analysis of already acquired data is also possible.

Other methodological aspects, especially on the bioinformitical level have to continue.
