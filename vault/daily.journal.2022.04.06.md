## Starting the day

First lets check the last discussions on the forum https://github.com/digitized-botanical-gardens-initiative/forum/discussions

### Today's Todo 

- [ ] Testing the lyophilisation technic
- [ ] Prelevating some plants in the botanical garden
- [ ]

### Today Notes & ideas
For the lyophilisation we have tested 15ml tubes, that is a bit small for correctly putting plant parts in it. 50ml would be better. We have tested two different technics to let the vacuum appen in the tube :
- Make little holes in the lid -> Echevaria elegans
- Let a bit open by not completely screw the lid -> Oscularia deltoides, Ephedra helvetica, Leonurus cardiaca, Echevaria elegans

Use of the lyophilisator :
- Turn on the button in the right of the machine
- Precool the machine (10 minutes) with the button on the screen
- Verify that all the circuit is closed (black wheel in the left of the screen and all the taps in the horizontal position)
- Put the sample in the jar and put it in one exit
- Open the tap (bigger part in the bottom)

The prelevated plants (4) of today are the same as the ones harvested by Pierre-Marie Allard 04th april that are the followings :

- https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/110561024

Today afternoon is the meeting with Horst Machguth that is the owner of the drone that we will use to cartography the botanical garden.

- [ ] Tomorrow morning is the meeting with Reynald Delaloye that permits to use DGPS to georeference the cartography of the botanical garden
