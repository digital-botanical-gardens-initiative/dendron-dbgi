This Bachelor project's takes place in the context of the DBGI. It thrives to test the implementation of UUIDs in the workflows developped by previous bachelor students. Furthermore, this tool could allow to link multiple samples to an individual instead of to a species. This, in term, could allow to increase the quantity of data attached to a single sample.
