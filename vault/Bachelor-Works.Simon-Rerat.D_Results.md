As results of this bachelor's work, a molecular network composed of 42 species and 110 samples has been created for a total of 14'563 nodes.

The content of the molecular network hasn't been finely studied, for it wasn't the goal of this project.

All the metadata used to produce such a network is accessible [here](https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/jbuf-trees/tree/main/docs/mapp_project_00067/mapp_batch_00174/metadata)
