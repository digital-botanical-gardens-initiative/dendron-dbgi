The entire potential of the UUIDs hasn't been fully tapped in and the other caracteristics of this tool can still be used for the development of the DBGI. Other projects such as monitoring the metabolome of individuals through time, or comparing the metabolomic content of different populations (wild VS garden) could allow to make use of other caracteristics of the UUIDs while checking if it is DBGI compatible.

Even tho progress has been made concerning the collection of the plants in the JBUF, a majority of plants still needs to be sampled (57.3% on the 27.06.2025). Therefore, the sampling has to go on. The progression of the different projects can be followed on [this link](https://emi-collection.unifr.ch/).

A more in depths analysis of the already acquired data is also possible, and would even be encouraged.

#TODO mayb not necessarily here, but please output a list of the species you have sampled and version it on github (check Jade's report for the example ) See https://github.com/jade147/jade_bachelor_work_repo/blob/a4491cbe601b38fbaab3b5437008505f01ea06e1/field_data_trimmed.csv
