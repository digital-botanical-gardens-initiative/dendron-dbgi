The entire potential of the UUIDs hasn't been fully tapped in and the other caracteristics of this tool can still be used for the development of the DBGI. Other projects such as monitoring the metabolome of individuals through time, or comparing the metabolomic content of different populations (wild VS garden) could allow to make use of other caracteristics of the UUIDs while checking if it is DBGI compatible.

A further analysis of the already acquired data is also possible.

The sampling of the JBUF has to go on.
