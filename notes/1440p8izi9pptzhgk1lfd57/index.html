<p>Ecosystem services, which derive in part from biological ø∂diversity, are a fundamental support for human society. However, human activities are causing harm to biodiversity, ultimately endangering these critical ecosystem services. Halting nature loss and mitigating these impacts necessitates comprehensive biodiversity distribution data, a requirement for implementing the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. To efficiently collect species observations from the public, we launched the ‘Biome’ mobile application in Japan. By employing species identification algorithms and gamification elements, the app has gathered >6M observations since its launch in 2019. However, community-sourced data often exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. Species distribution models (SDMs) enable infer species distribution while accommodating such bias. We investigated Biome data’s quality and how incorporating the data influences the performance of SDMs. Species identification accuracy exceeds 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but seed plants, molluscs, and fishes scored below 90%. The distributions of 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan were modeled, and their accuracy was improved by incorporating our data into traditional survey data. For endangered species, traditional survey data required >2,000 records to build accurate models (Boyce index ≥ 0.9), though only ca.300 records were required when the two data sources were blended. The unique data distributions may explain this improvement: Biome data covers urban-natural gradients uniformly, while traditional data is biased towards natural areas. Combining multiple data sources offers insights into species distributions across Japan, aiding protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment. Providing a platform to accumulate community-sourced distribution data and improving data processing protocol will contribute to not only conserving natural ecosystems but also detecting species distribution changes and testing ecological theories.</p>

<p>In previous research, researchers have looked into different
gamified applications of citizen science such as fold.it,
Zooniverse and Happy Moths. However, the users and
participants of these studies are often on different skill
levels, or beginners in the field. In this study, 10 expert
users who submit their findings of species to
Artdatabanken, an organisation that works in the field of
biodiversity, were interviewed to find out their motivations
for reporting their findings. This was done with the goal of
finding what type of gamification that might suit these
expert users to increase the quality of the data submitted
through Artportalen, together with any obstacles that might
hinder it. Through a latent thematic analysis and comparing
the themes to Bartle’s Taxonomy of Players, the results
show that these users were mainly of the types ‘achiever’
and ‘socialiser’. The answers were also compared to the
theory of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, which showed
that the users are mainly reporting because of extrinsic
motivation. While this supports the implementation of
gamification there were things that would rather be solved
by increasing usability.</p>

While this supports the implementation of\ngamification there were things that would rather be solved\nby increasing usability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"gaming-for-the-environment-how-games-are-modernizing-conservation\"\u003eGaming for the Environment: How Games are Modernizing Conservation\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#gaming-for-the-environment-how-games-are-modernizing-conservation\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://curiositysavestheplanet.com/gaming-for-the-environment-how-gamification-is-modernizing-conservation/\"\u003ehttps://curiositysavestheplanet.com/gaming-for-the-environment-how-gamification-is-modernizing-conservation/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"digital-games-and-biodiversity-conservation-1\"\u003eDigital Games and Biodiversity Conservation\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#digital-games-and-biodiversity-conservation-1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12113\"\u003ehttps://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12113\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigital games play an important role in the lives of millions of people worldwide. The games industry is expanding rapidly, and games are developing in sophistication and complexity. Games (and gaming approaches to other activities) are increasingly being used for serious or social purposes in a wide range of fields, including biodiversity conservation. This paper evaluates the potential of “conservation games” (digital games that promote conservation). It explores ways in which conservation might make use of digital games in the areas of (1) education and behavior change, (2) fundraising, and (3) research, monitoring, and planning. It discusses the risk that games may distract gamers from the real world and its problems or provide misleadingly simple narratives about conservation issues. We conclude that there is great potential for conservation to take more advantage of digital games, provided that conservation games are developed in collaboration with game design specialists, have specific rather than general aims, target a specific and conservation-relevant audience, and (above all) are fun to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e","noteIndex":{"id":"txkHnVTI9AawnquiublXO","title":"The DBGI Dendron notes","desc":"","updated":1688889927268,"created":1645438795591,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"fbac06bb8ff15f08a14f40cc7c9e268e","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"txkHnVTI9AawnquiublXO","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"open-notebook","position":{"start":{"line":28,"column":53,"offset":1976},"end":{"line":28,"column":70,"offset":1993},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"open-notebook"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"txkHnVTI9AawnquiublXO","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"welcome","position":{"start":{"line":34,"column":81,"offset":2595},"end":{"line":34,"column":92,"offset":2606},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"welcome"}},{"from":{"fname":"welcome","id":"tofizf0eb38rduuw6ffnzba","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":27,"offset":59},"end":{"line":5,"column":35,"offset":67},"indent":[]},"value":"root"}],"anchors":{"overview":{"type":"header","text":"Overview","value":"overview","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1},"main-goals":{"type":"header","text":"Main goals","value":"main-goals","line":12,"column":0,"depth":1},"an-open-science-project":{"type":"header","text":"An Open Science project","value":"an-open-science-project","line":18,"column":0,"depth":1},"working-with-the-workshop-doors-open":{"type":"header","text":"Working with the workshop doors open","value":"working-with-the-workshop-doors-open","line":21,"column":0,"depth":2},"open-notebook-science":{"type":"header","text":"Open Notebook Science","value":"open-notebook-science","line":28,"column":0,"depth":2},"whats-new-":{"type":"header","text":"What's new ?!","value":"whats-new-","line":43,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["il7c8piddciyg8dw5owj6ui","se2pzun6petcy32hf5j3wuw","bum7d9d6lnc0a863iqaogka","r23kzroton7bo017hsc6lmk","fmlpvd5ebpugd0idxhytk28","iq3hz5b7sskcu56bl8pgbwq","vphzpqwuu98x8sfgfrconej","hl55gsxxo1wlj1igs9mso7p","1sxxmo2bt2eans2xhdorb0q","8yees000uw0bxldzotr8uvw","9p6t4gle5zj5ilkd67j9rud","n9brxvyxekn9b8bv9d8xdik","7ic8gy5h3i6v906dzrig6hy","m0qwxiyv7i2hnkr3fk2m3by","o6r2k35gfsfur2gwgk56ra3","o2psjwj00vl4m8d7rgyfk9f","8u9qb1u3gp4e3osrb73xvor","f7cx4bd1mxjt63d0daza1xb","xoiil9w7pvz3ojhif2a8ppj","o8bu4pl5w2ag7o1h3401qgj","u9u4dax4f23kvq98mtw0ezj","eh30zgccb8kw1z36jlstijv","b17we89hoe3m5ulu9d1t8by","rnoodwuxipqxc8zdxt7kqdm","6c37mounk3i96bftncrvr29","p6xf974t6tqndzis0qjc9j6","165zhtrhauww30lf9dbp8fa","h2jxo1dbamqvqodtuopq9q1","1k6j3afbnh1kiyz95m1kyxz","dwyb49xky735sox320haxga","trzsyfzfrls2if6tjt9dy5u","nnhoqwog50xoiu1bzbn6cyj","q7siltgd71qf2xgppbysw35","tofizf0eb38rduuw6ffnzba","v3eyay0icafeftx6kbyemlm","h8trx40s491czjp1npypo68","eru1s83ybgl3raytc4dgeuz","lykjjec8x2kmqnxjz10nwm6","q8ucho0l7y37kqhprv8ku3k","fynboti1depbjpoz1whdnvt","il17okdfivbzsj1ij63uf8m"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Overview\n\nThe Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DBGI, www.dbgi.org) ambitions to explore innovative solutions for the collection, management and sharing of digital information acquired on living botanical collections. A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github. You can edit them by clicking on the \"Click here to edit this page on Github !\" link at the bottom of the page.
