<p>We are having some issues (stucked SPARQL queries, max 1 concurrent query, etc.) with the ENPKG GraphDB instance.
<a href="https://enpkg.commons-lab.org/graphdb/">https://enpkg.commons-lab.org/graphdb/</a></p>
<p>As discussed with Marco Pagni we should look into alternatives.
MP and Seb are looking into the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>RDF4J/Virtuoso</li>
<li>qendpoint <a href="https://the-qa-company.com/products/qEndpoint">https://the-qa-company.com/products/qEndpoint</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We should discuss these with Tarcisio and Ana.</p>
<p>Options I have briefly looked at this afternoon</p>
<ul>
<li>Ontop <a href="https://ontop-vkg.org/">https://ontop-vkg.org/</a></li>
<li>Blazegraph <a href="https://blazegraph.com/">https://blazegraph.com/</a></li>
<li>JanusGraph <a href="https://janusgraph.org/">https://janusgraph.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When looking at the possibilities to realize SPARQL queries in JanusGraph I found the following informative discussion:</p>
<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/g/janusgraph-users/c/I4rW_KhcgFE?pli=1">https://groups.google.com/g/janusgraph-users/c/I4rW_KhcgFE?pli=1</a></p>
<p>Notably Serge's comment </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general Property graph and RDF store have each their own advantage and it's more than a difference in implementation. I used the word general as some vendors are trying to reduce those difference. For example, Stardog extended SPARQL with a PATH operator which allow you to easily traverse a path which would usually be easier in a property graph.</p>
<p>Things to consider are: Do you want to benefit from inference. For example, A isFatherOf B and B isFatherOf C you could add a rule that when you ask who 'isGrandFatherof' C it would return A without really having it in the database. You could load different rules which can be useful. So that clearly an advantage of RDF. However RDF does not support attribute on your relationship directly. While it could be model, it could get complicated and be slow if most relationship requires attribute.</p>
<p>There are a few key difference like that that may make a technology better than another. I personally always start with a RDF solution, simply because I really am a fan of inference, and federated solution. If it does not work, it usually very easy to adjust the physical model to load in a property graph database.</p>
<p>Therefore I really recommend that you read up on both technology as which one you should use could be dictated by your use case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this brings a first question regarding the EMIKG. </p>
<ul>
<li>Do we want a Property Graph or a RDF store?</li>
</ul>
<p>or in other words</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we want to benefit from inference?</li>
<li>Do we want to have attributes on relationships?</li>
</ul>

A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github.
