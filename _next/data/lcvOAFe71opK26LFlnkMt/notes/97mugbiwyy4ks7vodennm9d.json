It may be a folder full of files, an abstract grouping of connected references, or a combination of both.</p>\n<p>The ro-crate-metadata.json file (also known as the RO-Crate Metadata Document) is a plain text file, readable by humans and machines, that includes metadata for each item within the collection - the authors, license, identifier, provenance, and so on. Any folder can be turned into an RO-Crate by adding an ro-crate-metadata.json file.</p>\n<p>Researchers can distribute their work as an RO-Crate to ensure their data travels with its metadata, so that key components are correctly tracked, archived, and attributed.</p>\n<p>RO-Crate uses the JSON-LD format, which is based on JSON. The ro-crate-metadata.json file can be written by hand or by using one of the existing tools.

Two key strands of genomic science provide opportunities to develop solutions to address the complex challenges of delivering knowledge to improve our capabilities for effective biomonitoring, biodiversity conservation, and species discovery. DNA barcoding is transforming the speed of completion of the inventory of life on Earth and providing the foundations of global biomonitoring systems. Genome sequencing is transforming understanding at the genetic level and delivering knowledge of how species adapt to environmental change.\nThis panel discussion aims to bring together experts from these two domains of genomic science in an open forum to (1) introduce the current state-of-the-art to the wider community of stakeholders in biodiversity research and policy; and (2) debate the priorities for addressing challenges and seizing opportunities needed to accelerate and integrate genomic science solutions into practices that enhance the efficacy of management interventions and biomonitoring programmes with state-of-the-art genomic tools.\nThe organisers of this panel discussion are coordinating the first large-scale pan-European effort to develop and strengthen functioning communities of practice in biodiversity genomics, the Biodiversity Genomics Europe (BGE) Project (<a href=\"https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/\">https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/</a>). The BGE Project is building European capacity, production, and applications in biodiversity genomics, from field sampling to DNA sequencing followed by data processing and analysis to drive applications in biomonitoring, conservation, and bioeconomy. The panel will comprise two representatives of the BGE Project as well as one representative each from the global umbrella networks the International Barcode of Life (iBOL) and the Earth BioGenome Project (EBP).</p>\n<p>Organizers and Panellists\nRobert Waterhouse – Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (Switzerland): organiser, moderator\nDimitris Koureas – Naturalis Biodiversity Center (Netherlands): organiser, panellist</p>\n<p>Failed to foresee the issues related to Nagoya protocol</p>\n<p>Camila Mazzoni – Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (Germany): organiser, panellist\nRutger Vos – Naturalis Biodiversity Center (Netherlands): panellist</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.naturalis.nl/en/science/researchers/rutger-vos\">https://www.naturalis.nl/en/science/researchers/rutger-vos</a></p>\n<p>Bioinformatics</p>\n<p>Harris Lewin – Earth Biogenome Project: panellist</p>\n<p>EBP - Earth BioGenome Project started 2018\n58 differents projects.

The sheer number of publications produced annually, and a backlog of hundreds of millions of pages make it impossible to keep up with this knowledge, even for a restricted topic. Also the discovery of new relevant publications is challenging, albeit in a digital world this could be instantaneous. This has an impact from reviewing the state and changes in biodiversity and its causes to measuring and understanding the impact of recommendations. It contributes to a North-South divide of access to this information, and it is not suited to make use of  fledgling artificial intelligence applications to mine and discover the wealth embedded in this data.\nRecent developments in converting scientific publications or publishing them from the beginning in machine-actionable, semantic blocks of text are leading a way forwards for example to access data about species or discover biotic interactions. Furthermore, since these blocks of text or data are made findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR data) through the Biodiversity Literature Repository (BLR) and the biodiversityPMC, this opens scientific publications to everybody, as well as to advanced data analytic and artificial  tools. It also enables customizing the annotations in publications for domain specific purposes, for example to support reporting in IPBES.\nIn this session an overview will be provided of how to access biodiversity data through the biodiversityPMC and BLR, how publications can be processed after publishing or published in machine actionable ways to import into biodiversityPMC and BLR, and how the data is being used. Part of the session will include representative invited lectures the other part will be used for a discussion with potential stakeholders.\nConfirmed speakers\nLaurence Bénichou, Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle, Paris, France\nRainer Krug, Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies.

Particularly welcome are papers that address the general theme of the conference, from science to action. Potential other topics include:\n• The philosophy of valuing and protecting biodiversity\n• Justice and politics in biodiversity conservation, including such issues as ownership of genetic resources, democracy and biodiversity, transparency of biodiversity data, bio/ecosecurity\n• Ethical analysis of different conservation techniques and strategies such as de-extinction, natural vs. artificial biodiversity conservation, assisted migration, ecological restoration and rewilding\n• Analysis and critique of the biodiversity concept in environmental philosophy and promising alternative concepts\nWe are open to presentations from different philosophical positions and traditions.\nWe organise two sessions during the conference, and presentations will be grouped by their content with one session dedicated to more abstract deliberations in terms of conceptual analysis, value-theory, biodiversity as a philosophical problem etc. and a second session being primarily dedicated to application/policy-orientated normative questions. Especially welcome are abstracts that focus on a philosophical analysis of science, ethics, and policy. The WBF conference attracts an interdisciplinary academic audience that is interested in different aspects of biodiversity conservation. Therefore, we emphasize that presentations should address an interdisciplinary audience. Interested presenters will also have the opportunity to share their presentations in form of draft papers with the other thematic session participants before the conference to allow for further in-depth exchange (optional pre-read papers).\nConveners\nMarkku Oksanen, Department of Social Sciences, University of Eastern Finland, P.O.Box 1627, 70211 Kuopio, Finland, <a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/mailto:markku.oksanen@uef.fi\">markku.oksanen@uef.fi</a>\nAnna Deplazes Zemp, Department of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich, <a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/mailto:anna.deplazeszemp@uzh.ch\">anna.deplazeszemp@uzh.ch</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"252-conserving-biodiversity-through-eating-is-there-a-case-for-veganism\">252 CONSERVING BIODIVERSITY THROUGH EATING: IS THERE A CASE FOR VEGANISM?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#252-conserving-biodiversity-through-eating-is-there-a-case-for-veganism\"></a></h3>\n<p>Oral Presenter: Markku Oksanen (Kuopio, Finland)\n09:30 – 09:45\n15 min</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepomis_gibbosus\">https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepomis_gibbosus</a></p>\n<p>### 371 SHOULD NON-HUMAN ORGANISMS HAVE A RIGHT TO A LIVABLE LOCALITY?\nOral Presenter: Simona Capisani (Durham, United Kingdom)\n09:45 – 10:00\n15 min</p>\n<h3 id=\"373-three-dimensions-of-urgency\">373 THREE DIMENSIONS OF URGENCY<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#373-three-dimensions-of-urgency\"></a></h3>\n<p>Oral Presenter: Yasha Rohwer (Wilsonville, United States)\nOral Presenter: Evelyn Brister (Rochester, United States)\n10:00 – 10:15\n15 min</p>\n<p>3 dimensions of the concept of Urgency.\nRarely well defined</p>\n<h3 id=\"408-sustainability-and-habitat-rights\">408 SUSTAINABILITY AND HABITAT RIGHTS<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#408-sustainability-and-habitat-rights\"></a></h3>\n<p>Oral Presenter: Anna Wienhues (Oslo, Norway)\n10:15 – 10:30\n15 min</p>\n<h3 id=\"777-why-biodiversity-ethics\">777 WHY BIODIVERSITY ETHICS?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#777-why-biodiversity-ethics\"></a></h3>\n<p>Oral Presenter: Gesine Schepers (Bielefeld, Germany)</p>\n<p>Plenary Lecture\nPlenary hall\nThursday, June 20, 08:00 – 09:30\nPle_Thu_1 Plenary Thursday morning\nThe diversity of life is constantly evolving and changing - forming the Tree of Life. The Tree of Life can be regarded as a unifying framework that can inform biodiversity conservation. Successful conservation of biodiversity also requires to recognise nature as a stakeholder.

These processes and their participants – metabolites – govern relationships of living beings to each other and the Earth system.  Humans depend on the metabolites of other organisms for nutrition and medicines. Yet we have identified only a minute fraction (~0.02%) of the millions of metabolites estimated to be produced across the Tree of Life. This fundamental aspect of biodiversity is a treasure chest yet to be unlocked, and with every species lost it is sinking out of reach.\nBy describing the ensemble of metabolites – the metabolome – of every organism, the Earth Metabolome Initiative (EMI) aims to reveal the mechanisms that orchestrate and maintain living systems. This information will be digitized and organized in an open knowledge base and accompanied by a metabolome biobank. An ongoing pilot project, the Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DBGI), is now developing open science workflows for digitization of chemodiversity from botanical collections. We expect the EMI to identify new ways to conserve, use and manage chemodiversity sustainably, thus directly contributing to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.\nThis open session aims to bring together and align EMI members with researchers, prac­ti­tion­ers and so­ci­etal ac­tors. Presentations will focus on the challenge posed by the EMI: to catalog, contextualize, interpret, and make open Earth’s chemodiversity.

A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github. You can edit them by clicking on the \"Click here to edit this page on Github !\" link at the bottom of the page.
