A particular focus is placed on the large-scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plant collections through mass spectrometry. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through semantic web technology. After validation and application in wild ecosystems, the gathered knowledge will inform ecosystem functioning research and orient biodiversity conservation projects.\nOne central aspect of the DBGI thus resides in the acquisition of high quality information on the digitised chemodiversity which in turns rely essentially in efficient metabolite annotation. For this we employ a taxonomically informed metabolite annotation process (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.01329\">https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.01329</a>), which we have shown to systematically improve the performance of state-of-the computational metabolite annotation solutions. A requirement for this process is to access comprehensive ressources documenting the biological occurrence of small molecules. For this we recently opened the LOTUS ressource (<a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/70780\">https://elifesciences.org/articles/70780</a>) to the community. However, numerous biological occurrences of natural products are still lacking. </p>\n<p>We would like to evaluate the BiCICKL Research Infrastructures to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improve past knowledge exploitation: extract pairs of chemical compound and taxon from literature not present in LOTUS and relevant to the DBGI (papers describing phytochemical investigation of plants of the Swiss Botanical Gardens, e.g. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.112469\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.112469</a>)  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enhance future knowledge dissemination: explore publication solutions to efficiently disseminate knowledge acquired from metabolomics, that is, putative occurrences of chemical structures in biological matrices (simple RDF triples, Nanopublications (<a href=\"https://nanopub.org/\">https://nanopub.org/</a>)  or similar).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"proposal\">Proposal<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#proposal\"></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RgzNW_gL0UVj8oJ3yz7Dj9APq1r5cjR41zsVdcvGdeo/edit#heading=h.ngrefc2bpjv2\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RgzNW_gL0UVj8oJ3yz7Dj9APq1r5cjR41zsVdcvGdeo/edit#heading=h.ngrefc2bpjv2</a></p>\n<p>On the 20th February we received the good news that our proposal was accepted !

A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github.
