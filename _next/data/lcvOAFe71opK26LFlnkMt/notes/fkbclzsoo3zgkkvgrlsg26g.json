Optionnaly, you can activate the GPS location to locate you approximatively on the field. When you point the plant location, tap on the \"plus\" button. This will make appear a form. sample_name field corresponds to the scientific name of the plant (open form where you can search on). sample is the code sticked on the tube. You can scan it by clicking on the 3 dots. Then you have 5 pictures to take of the species, one of the species labe (if available), one in general, one of the plant's details (flowers or remarkable details that permit identification), one where you cut and one with the species label (if availabe) and the dbgi code on the tube. Once done, the upper of the form should be green, and you can add you observation to the project.</p>\n<p> This system works offline, so each time you finish your collection, you need to update the project on the server. To do that, click on the little cloud and click on \"push modifications\". Wait until all is synced (don't close everything when you are seeing the \"finished\" text, because pictures are also uploaded, and it takes some time. You will have a notification that is saying that the process is in progress. When the notification disapears, you can close the application). Before each collection, please synce the project to not create syncronization problems. It will take the latest files on the server and store it locally on your phone.</p>\n<p> <img src=\"/dendron-dbgi/assets/images/QField_settings.png\" alt=\"QField interface\" style=\"max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;\"></p>","noteIndex":{"id":"txkHnVTI9AawnquiublXO","title":"The DBGI Dendron notes","desc":"","updated":1688889927268,"created":1645438795591,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"fbac06bb8ff15f08a14f40cc7c9e268e","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"txkHnVTI9AawnquiublXO","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"open-notebook","position":{"start":{"line":28,"column":53,"offset":1976},"end":{"line":28,"column":70,"offset":1993},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"open-notebook"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"txkHnVTI9AawnquiublXO","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"welcome","position":{"start":{"line":34,"column":81,"offset":2595},"end":{"line":34,"column":92,"offset":2606},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"welcome"}},{"from":{"fname":"welcome","id":"tofizf0eb38rduuw6ffnzba","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":27,"offset":59},"end":{"line":5,"column":35,"offset":67},"indent":[]},"value":"root"}],"anchors":{"overview":{"type":"header","text":"Overview","value":"overview","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1},"main-goals":{"type":"header","text":"Main goals","value":"main-goals","line":12,"column":0,"depth":1},"an-open-science-project":{"type":"header","text":"An Open Science project","value":"an-open-science-project","line":18,"column":0,"depth":1},"working-with-the-workshop-doors-open":{"type":"header","text":"Working with the workshop doors open","value":"working-with-the-workshop-doors-open","line":21,"column":0,"depth":2},"open-notebook-science":{"type":"header","text":"Open Notebook Science","value":"open-notebook-science","line":28,"column":0,"depth":2},"whats-new-":{"type":"header","text":"What's new ?!","value":"whats-new-","line":43,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["il7c8piddciyg8dw5owj6ui","se2pzun6petcy32hf5j3wuw","bum7d9d6lnc0a863iqaogka","r23kzroton7bo017hsc6lmk","fmlpvd5ebpugd0idxhytk28","iq3hz5b7sskcu56bl8pgbwq","vphzpqwuu98x8sfgfrconej","hl55gsxxo1wlj1igs9mso7p","1sxxmo2bt2eans2xhdorb0q","8yees000uw0bxldzotr8uvw","9p6t4gle5zj5ilkd67j9rud","n9brxvyxekn9b8bv9d8xdik","7ic8gy5h3i6v906dzrig6hy","m0qwxiyv7i2hnkr3fk2m3by","o6r2k35gfsfur2gwgk56ra3","o2psjwj00vl4m8d7rgyfk9f","8u9qb1u3gp4e3osrb73xvor","f7cx4bd1mxjt63d0daza1xb","xoiil9w7pvz3ojhif2a8ppj","o8bu4pl5w2ag7o1h3401qgj","u9u4dax4f23kvq98mtw0ezj","eh30zgccb8kw1z36jlstijv","b17we89hoe3m5ulu9d1t8by","rnoodwuxipqxc8zdxt7kqdm","6c37mounk3i96bftncrvr29","p6xf974t6tqndzis0qjc9j6","165zhtrhauww30lf9dbp8fa","h2jxo1dbamqvqodtuopq9q1","1k6j3afbnh1kiyz95m1kyxz","dwyb49xky735sox320haxga","trzsyfzfrls2if6tjt9dy5u","nnhoqwog50xoiu1bzbn6cyj","q7siltgd71qf2xgppbysw35","tofizf0eb38rduuw6ffnzba","v3eyay0icafeftx6kbyemlm","h8trx40s491czjp1npypo68","eru1s83ybgl3raytc4dgeuz","lykjjec8x2kmqnxjz10nwm6","q8ucho0l7y37kqhprv8ku3k","fynboti1depbjpoz1whdnvt","il17okdfivbzsj1ij63uf8m"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Overview\n\nThe Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DBGI, www.dbgi.org) ambitions to explore innovative solutions for the collection, management and sharing of digital information acquired on living botanical collections. A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github. You can edit them by clicking on the \"Click here to edit this page on Github !\" link at the bottom of the page. See down there 👇\n\nIf you are willing to participate the the DBGI Dendron notes have a look at the [[welcome]] section to get you started !\n\n\n## What's new ?!\n\nThis web site might not necessarily seem to be change since the last time you came to visit.\n\nIf something moved recently you should be able to track this over there https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/dendron-dbgi/commits/main"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.84.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"hooks":{"onCreate":[{"id":"hello","pattern":"hello.*","type":"js"}]}},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"DBGI Dendron page","description":"Open Notebook Science in the DBGI"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Participate and click here to edit this page on Github !","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/dendron-dbgi"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"enableHierarchyDisplay":true,"assetsPrefix":"/dendron-dbgi","siteUrl":"https://digital-botanical-gardens-initiative.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"ga":{"tracking":"G-EPEXM5GLLG"},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
