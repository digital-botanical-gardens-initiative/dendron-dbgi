But the equipment was unsuitable and needs to be reviewed for the next collection. First problem : the label didnt stick well, two of them lost it in the nitrogen box. fibl_000084 and filb_000081 are possibly mixed, even if we attributed the label back based on the diversity of plants inside the zip-lock. Second problem :  Zip-locks are too fagile and disintegrate in liquid nitrogen. We nedd to find some more solide zip-lock, or boxes that we can put in the liquide nitrogen. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Methode 2 : mesofauna extraction\nExtracor berlese is running, we have done the 2 first extraction on the weekend right after the collecte (D+1). Some worms, ents, and other could be extracted. But, for the second extraction, the soil seems to be deteriorating in the fridge, with traces of mould on plant remains. Several earthworms already dead. We are waiting to see if we still can extracted some mesofauna. Probably the 3th and 4th will be even more deteriorating. The technique is working but we need to have one set up for each and do the extraction quite quick after the collect. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Methode 3 : 1x1m plantes extractions\nThis methode were not applied in the field. Taking all the plant in a 1 per 1 meter square would have taken too much time during the collection. It was not suitable for this collect. Instead we have lookes for paires of plantes that we can find in the conventional and the biodynamic plot to compare them. We could find some potatoes (last year crop) in each plot, as well as some grasses. We also collected some random plants and other (insect, gasteropod) to add them at the database. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Methode 4 : soil extraction\nThis methode was applied correctly in each plot. We are waiting to see how the extraction can go. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"txkHnVTI9AawnquiublXO","title":"The DBGI Dendron notes","desc":"","updated":1688889927268,"created":1645438795591,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"fbac06bb8ff15f08a14f40cc7c9e268e","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"txkHnVTI9AawnquiublXO","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"open-notebook","position":{"start":{"line":28,"column":53,"offset":1976},"end":{"line":28,"column":70,"offset":1993},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"open-notebook"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"txkHnVTI9AawnquiublXO","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"welcome","position":{"start":{"line":34,"column":81,"offset":2595},"end":{"line":34,"column":92,"offset":2606},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"welcome"}},{"from":{"fname":"welcome","id":"tofizf0eb38rduuw6ffnzba","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":27,"offset":59},"end":{"line":5,"column":35,"offset":67},"indent":[]},"value":"root"}],"anchors":{"overview":{"type":"header","text":"Overview","value":"overview","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1},"main-goals":{"type":"header","text":"Main goals","value":"main-goals","line":12,"column":0,"depth":1},"an-open-science-project":{"type":"header","text":"An Open Science project","value":"an-open-science-project","line":18,"column":0,"depth":1},"working-with-the-workshop-doors-open":{"type":"header","text":"Working with the workshop doors open","value":"working-with-the-workshop-doors-open","line":21,"column":0,"depth":2},"open-notebook-science":{"type":"header","text":"Open Notebook Science","value":"open-notebook-science","line":28,"column":0,"depth":2},"whats-new-":{"type":"header","text":"What's new ?!","value":"whats-new-","line":43,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["il7c8piddciyg8dw5owj6ui","se2pzun6petcy32hf5j3wuw","bum7d9d6lnc0a863iqaogka","r23kzroton7bo017hsc6lmk","fmlpvd5ebpugd0idxhytk28","iq3hz5b7sskcu56bl8pgbwq","vphzpqwuu98x8sfgfrconej","hl55gsxxo1wlj1igs9mso7p","1sxxmo2bt2eans2xhdorb0q","8yees000uw0bxldzotr8uvw","9p6t4gle5zj5ilkd67j9rud","n9brxvyxekn9b8bv9d8xdik","7ic8gy5h3i6v906dzrig6hy","m0qwxiyv7i2hnkr3fk2m3by","o6r2k35gfsfur2gwgk56ra3","o2psjwj00vl4m8d7rgyfk9f","8u9qb1u3gp4e3osrb73xvor","f7cx4bd1mxjt63d0daza1xb","xoiil9w7pvz3ojhif2a8ppj","o8bu4pl5w2ag7o1h3401qgj","u9u4dax4f23kvq98mtw0ezj","eh30zgccb8kw1z36jlstijv","b17we89hoe3m5ulu9d1t8by","rnoodwuxipqxc8zdxt7kqdm","6c37mounk3i96bftncrvr29","p6xf974t6tqndzis0qjc9j6","165zhtrhauww30lf9dbp8fa","h2jxo1dbamqvqodtuopq9q1","1k6j3afbnh1kiyz95m1kyxz","dwyb49xky735sox320haxga","trzsyfzfrls2if6tjt9dy5u","nnhoqwog50xoiu1bzbn6cyj","q7siltgd71qf2xgppbysw35","tofizf0eb38rduuw6ffnzba","v3eyay0icafeftx6kbyemlm","h8trx40s491czjp1npypo68","eru1s83ybgl3raytc4dgeuz","lykjjec8x2kmqnxjz10nwm6","q8ucho0l7y37kqhprv8ku3k","fynboti1depbjpoz1whdnvt","il17okdfivbzsj1ij63uf8m"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Overview\n\nThe Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DBGI, www.dbgi.org) ambitions to explore innovative solutions for the collection, management and sharing of digital information acquired on living botanical collections. A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github. You can edit them by clicking on the \"Click here to edit this page on Github !\" link at the bottom of the page.
