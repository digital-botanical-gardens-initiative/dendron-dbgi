In addition to individual samples, IGSN IDs may also be assigned to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Collections or aggregations of samples.</strong> You may not want to have a PID for every object within a collection. If a whole aggregate is usually referenced, it can be registered with an IGSN ID. Additional IGSN IDs may then be registered for specific samples within the collection as necessary. Such samples are children of the parent collection and may be connected in the metadata using relatedIdentifers.</li>\n<li><strong>Features-of-interest.</strong> A material sample is a specialization of a â€˜feature-of-interestâ€™ upon which the sampling activity was carried out; namely, the collection site (such a site may not exist for samples that are synthesized in a laboratory). Similar to collections, samples in this case are children of their parent feature-of-interest.</li>\n<li><strong>Ephemeral samples.</strong> Non-persistent material samples may be registered with IGSN IDs. It is common for samples to be destroyed during an analytical process or discarded after testing; they may also degrade over time. For synthesized samples, they may exist only at a certain point during the experimental process before disappearing again. In all cases, the sample metadata should provide clear information on the current status of the sample.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These three types of use cases (collections, features-of-interest, and ephemeral samples) should cover the majority of physical samples in the frame of DBGI/EMI.</p>\n<p>Sandbox at <a href=\"https://doi.test.datacite.org/\">https://doi.test.datacite.org/</a> (credentials available on request)</p>\n<p>Organization Fee\nThe organization fee for non-profit organizations is 500â‚¬ per year.

A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github. You can edit them by clicking on the \"Click here to edit this page on Github !\" link at the bottom of the page.
