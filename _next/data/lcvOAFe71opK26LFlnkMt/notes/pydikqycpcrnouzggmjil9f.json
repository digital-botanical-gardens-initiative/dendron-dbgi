Thes control points (Figure 1) are geolocated with a differential GPS that permits to obtain data with an error of less than 3 centimenters (Figure 2). After that, we make the drone fly with an app called \"DroneDeploy\" that automatically makes fly the drone (Figure 3) and takes pictures of the zone to have a complete mapping.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/dendron-dbgi/assets/images/ground_control_points.png\" alt=\"ground control points\" style=\"max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;\"><em>Figure 1 : Map of the Fribourg botanical garden with control points (<a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/notes/ztlzk5dmtvco58whz3logbq\">_d</a>).</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/dendron-dbgi/assets/images/gps.jpg\" alt=\"GPS\" style=\"max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;\"><em>Figure 2 : Leica differential GPS with the GSM technology</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/dendron-dbgi/assets/images/drone.jpg\" alt=\"drone\" style=\"max-width:600px;display:block;margin:0 auto;\"><em>Figure 3 : DJI Mavic pro 2 drone with the first ground marker</em></p>\n<p>With these steps, we obtain approximatively 260 high quality pictures with the geolocated ground markers visible on them.

Then we sync this QGIS project online in QFIeldCloud. With the QField app, we can go with a smartphone on the field and add the samples one by one when we prelevate. Then, we can push the field data and synchronize them with the QGIs project</p>\n<p>Then, we can extract the WGS84 coordinates from the QGIS project in a CSV to add them on Inaturalist to have the high precision sample geolocation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#acknowledgements\"></a></h2>\n<p>The creation of the drone map has been made possible with the help the Geosciences department, geography unit of the University of Fribourg.

A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github.
