Pollution is choking our oceans, climate change is wreaking havoc on ecosystems, and critical resources like clean water are under immense strain. While collective action is urgently needed, motivating people to make greener choices in their daily lives can be difficult. This is where gamification comes in.</p>\n<p>Gamification involves applying game mechanics like points, badges, and leaderboards to real-world contexts. This taps into people’s natural desires for competition, achievement, and connection. Gamification is now being powerfully leveraged to drive positive environmental behaviors across the globe. Exciting apps and platforms are gamifying activities like recycling, energy conservation, sustainable transportation and more.

However, human activities are causing harm to biodiversity, ultimately endangering these critical ecosystem services. Halting nature loss and mitigating these impacts necessitates comprehensive biodiversity distribution data, a requirement for implementing the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. To efficiently collect species observations from the public, we launched the ‘Biome’ mobile application in Japan. By employing species identification algorithms and gamification elements, the app has gathered >6M observations since its launch in 2019. However, community-sourced data often exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. Species distribution models (SDMs) enable infer species distribution while accommodating such bias. We investigated Biome data’s quality and how incorporating the data influences the performance of SDMs. Species identification accuracy exceeds 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but seed plants, molluscs, and fishes scored below 90%. The distributions of 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan were modeled, and their accuracy was improved by incorporating our data into traditional survey data. For endangered species, traditional survey data required >2,000 records to build accurate models (Boyce index ≥ 0.9), though only ca.300 records were required when the two data sources were blended. The unique data distributions may explain this improvement: Biome data covers urban-natural gradients uniformly, while traditional data is biased towards natural areas. Combining multiple data sources offers insights into species distributions across Japan, aiding protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment. Providing a platform to accumulate community-sourced distribution data and improving data processing protocol will contribute to not only conserving natural ecosystems but also detecting species distribution changes and testing ecological theories.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"digital-games-and-biodiversity-conservation\">Digital Games and Biodiversity Conservation<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#digital-games-and-biodiversity-conservation\"></a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12113\">https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12113</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Digital games play an important role in the lives of millions of people worldwide.

In this study, 10 expert\nusers who submit their findings of species to\nArtdatabanken, an organisation that works in the field of\nbiodiversity, were interviewed to find out their motivations\nfor reporting their findings. This was done with the goal of\nfinding what type of gamification that might suit these\nexpert users to increase the quality of the data submitted\nthrough Artportalen, together with any obstacles that might\nhinder it. Through a latent thematic analysis and comparing\nthe themes to Bartle’s Taxonomy of Players, the results\nshow that these users were mainly of the types ‘achiever’\nand ‘socialiser’. The answers were also compared to the\ntheory of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, which showed\nthat the users are mainly reporting because of extrinsic\nmotivation.

A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github.
