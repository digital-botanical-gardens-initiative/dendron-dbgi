The freeze drying process lasts two to three days, depending on the nature and water content of the samples.

Three scenarios have been tested, following the extraction needs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Normal case, the sample weights more than 50 milligrams and there is no need to extract in big quantity: 50 milligrams are weighted and put in a safelock tube of 2 milliliters with three metal beads.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Exception, the sample weights less than 50 milligrams: The entire field sample is weighted and put in 2 milliliters safelocks. If the weight is under or equal to 10 milligrams, 1 bead is added. If the weight is above 10 and under or equal to 30 milligrams, 2 beads are added. If the weight is above 30, 3 beads are added. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bigger extractions: For extractions that exceed 50 milligrams of dry material, there is no special guideline. As the quantity is too big to be extracted in a 2 milliliters safelock, the use of another container is mandatory.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To prepare for extraction, samples are then crushed. Until 50 milligrams of dry material, use of ballmill is the best way. It is why we add metal beads.</p>\n<h2 id=\"extraction\">Extraction<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#extraction\"></a></h2>\n<p>After weighting, samples need to be extracted. The extraction process we use is the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>0.5, 1 or 1.5ml of mix 80% methanol, 20% distillated water ans 0.1% formic acid is added (depending on the original weight).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Second ballmill to maximize extraction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Centrifugated 2 minutes at 13'000RPM</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1.4ml of supernatent is prelevated and stored in 1.5ml vials with non split caps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Storage at -80°C.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This extraction protocol is the classical one for the DBGI project. However, our tracking system permits to add other protocols for different purposes (for example bigger extractions than 1.5ml).</p>\n<h2 id=\"aliquot\">Aliquot<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#aliquot\"></a></h2>\n<p>The aliquot object is the one that will be injected.  It permits to keep the extract in the freezer to limit contaminations and degradations. To proceed, a defined volume of the extract is prelevated and put in another vial containing an insert. Usually we will aliquot 150 µl of the mother vial.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mass-spectrometry\"><a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/notes/gt1q9bzu5eep82sxxog219k\">Mass spectrometry</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#mass-spectrometry\"></a></h2>\n<p>Once aliquots are made, they can be analyzed with a mass spectrometer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"laboratory-application\"><a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/notes/v3k7t8ndaj4nfo3hgapg2ap\">Laboratory Application</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#laboratory-application\"></a></h2>\n<p>All this process is made using a <a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/notes/v3k7t8ndaj4nfo3hgapg2ap\">Laboratory Application</a> that permits to collect metadata, to track samples and to print labels.</p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/notes/i6scy8dy7a9appqdqvxas6j\">Collection</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/notes/5u2uiaco359415r2i31ymac\">Methods</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"txkHnVTI9AawnquiublXO","title":"The DBGI Dendron notes","desc":"","updated":1688889927268,"created":1645438795591,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"fbac06bb8ff15f08a14f40cc7c9e268e","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"txkHnVTI9AawnquiublXO","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"open-notebook","position":{"start":{"line":28,"column":53,"offset":1976},"end":{"line":28,"column":70,"offset":1993},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"open-notebook"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"txkHnVTI9AawnquiublXO","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"welcome","position":{"start":{"line":34,"column":81,"offset":2595},"end":{"line":34,"column":92,"offset":2606},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"welcome"}},{"from":{"fname":"welcome","id":"tofizf0eb38rduuw6ffnzba","vaultName":"vault"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":27,"offset":59},"end":{"line":5,"column":35,"offset":67},"indent":[]},"value":"root"}],"anchors":{"overview":{"type":"header","text":"Overview","value":"overview","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1},"main-goals":{"type":"header","text":"Main goals","value":"main-goals","line":12,"column":0,"depth":1},"an-open-science-project":{"type":"header","text":"An Open Science project","value":"an-open-science-project","line":18,"column":0,"depth":1},"working-with-the-workshop-doors-open":{"type":"header","text":"Working with the workshop doors open","value":"working-with-the-workshop-doors-open","line":21,"column":0,"depth":2},"open-notebook-science":{"type":"header","text":"Open Notebook Science","value":"open-notebook-science","line":28,"column":0,"depth":2},"whats-new-":{"type":"header","text":"What's new ?!","value":"whats-new-","line":43,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["il7c8piddciyg8dw5owj6ui","se2pzun6petcy32hf5j3wuw","bum7d9d6lnc0a863iqaogka","r23kzroton7bo017hsc6lmk","fmlpvd5ebpugd0idxhytk28","iq3hz5b7sskcu56bl8pgbwq","vphzpqwuu98x8sfgfrconej","hl55gsxxo1wlj1igs9mso7p","1sxxmo2bt2eans2xhdorb0q","8yees000uw0bxldzotr8uvw","9p6t4gle5zj5ilkd67j9rud","n9brxvyxekn9b8bv9d8xdik","7ic8gy5h3i6v906dzrig6hy","m0qwxiyv7i2hnkr3fk2m3by","o6r2k35gfsfur2gwgk56ra3","o2psjwj00vl4m8d7rgyfk9f","8u9qb1u3gp4e3osrb73xvor","f7cx4bd1mxjt63d0daza1xb","xoiil9w7pvz3ojhif2a8ppj","o8bu4pl5w2ag7o1h3401qgj","u9u4dax4f23kvq98mtw0ezj","eh30zgccb8kw1z36jlstijv","b17we89hoe3m5ulu9d1t8by","rnoodwuxipqxc8zdxt7kqdm","6c37mounk3i96bftncrvr29","p6xf974t6tqndzis0qjc9j6","165zhtrhauww30lf9dbp8fa","h2jxo1dbamqvqodtuopq9q1","1k6j3afbnh1kiyz95m1kyxz","dwyb49xky735sox320haxga","trzsyfzfrls2if6tjt9dy5u","nnhoqwog50xoiu1bzbn6cyj","q7siltgd71qf2xgppbysw35","tofizf0eb38rduuw6ffnzba","v3eyay0icafeftx6kbyemlm","h8trx40s491czjp1npypo68","eru1s83ybgl3raytc4dgeuz","lykjjec8x2kmqnxjz10nwm6","q8ucho0l7y37kqhprv8ku3k","fynboti1depbjpoz1whdnvt","il17okdfivbzsj1ij63uf8m"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Overview\n\nThe Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DBGI, www.dbgi.org) ambitions to explore innovative solutions for the collection, management and sharing of digital information acquired on living botanical collections. A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github.
