The location is randomly chose in on of the side row of the plot (the middle row is reserved for measuring yield and cannot be touched).  All the crops, weeds and others wich are found in this square are cut at their base and put in zip-lock prelabbeled with an unique code. The entire zip-lock is then immersed in liquid nitrogen. The sample are store at -80Â°C waiting for the extraction process. </p>\n<p>Each type of agricuture is replicated four times on the DOK experiment.

They are then placed in a blender with a proportional amount of 200ml/40g of the dbgi extraction mix. The plants are blended until a homogeneous fluid is obtained. Six grams of this fluid are set appart in a falcon tube and 34 milliter of the dbgi mix are added to reconstituate the ratio of dbgi extraction. A second tube is completely filled with plant extract and stored at -80Â°C for future extractions. </p>\n<p>Alternately the sample can be dry crushed in the blender and store as a dry powder.

A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github.
