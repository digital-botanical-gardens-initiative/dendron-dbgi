A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github. You can edit them by clicking on the \"Click here to edit this page on Github !\" link at the bottom of the page. See down there 👇\n\nIf you are willing to participate the the DBGI Dendron notes have a look at the [[welcome]] section to get you started !\n\n\n## What's new ?!\n\nThis web site might not necessarily seem to be change since the last time you came to visit.\n\nIf something moved recently you should be able to track this over there https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/dendron-dbgi/commits/main"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.84.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"hooks":{"onCreate":[{"id":"hello","pattern":"hello.*","type":"js"}]}},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"DBGI Dendron page","description":"Open Notebook Science in the DBGI"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Participate and click here to edit this page on Github !","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/dendron-dbgi"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"enableHierarchyDisplay":true,"assetsPrefix":"/dendron-dbgi","siteUrl":"https://digital-botanical-gardens-initiative.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"ga":{"tracking":"G-EPEXM5GLLG"},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
