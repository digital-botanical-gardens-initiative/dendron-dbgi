Disclaimer: I am very new to RO and the ontology world in general please excuse me in case I say any absurdities.\nI would like to find the appropriate RO property to express the fact that a given molecule has been found in a given taxon. In LOTUS (an electronic ressource documenting occurence of small molecules across the tree of life) we have used the Wikidata P703 \"found_in_taxon\" property. E.g. erythromycin is found in taxon Aeromicrobium erythreum. Now I somehow found that the <a href=\"https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/in_taxon/\">https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/in_taxon/</a> LinkML model states that this in_taxon is exactly mapped to RO:0002162 and P703.  Before using RO:0002162 I would like to make sure that there is no better suited property.\nOne thing that made doubt is the fact that the description states : \"Connects a biological entity to its taxon of origin.\" and that I am here trying to link a chemical entity to its taxon of origin.\nThe other doubt I had was that \"Connects a biological entity to its taxon of origin.\" could also be interpreted as organism X (for example this specimen defined by an iNaturalist observation) is connected to its taxon of origin in this case Arabidopsis thaliana (55021 or Q158695)\n(edited)</p>\n<p>eLifeeLife\nThe LOTUS initiative for open knowledge management in natural products research\nThe LOTUS initiative builds, through the Wikidata knowledge graph, a virtuous cycle of data sharing practices for natural products research.</p>\n<p>wikidata.orgwikidata.org\nfound in taxon\nthe taxon in which the item can be found</p>\n<p>wikidata.orgwikidata.org\nerythromycin\nchemical compound</p>\n<p>wikidata.orgwikidata.org\nAeromicrobium erythreum\nspecies of bacterium\n11 replies</p>\n<p>Ray Stefancsik\n5 days ago\nHave you considered using RO:0002175 present in taxon alone or in combination with other properties?\nebi.ac.ukebi.ac.uk\nOntology Lookup Service (OLS)\nOLS is a repository for biomedical ontologies that aims to provide a single point of access to the latest ontology versions\n:+1:\n1</p>\n<p>Pierre-Marie Allard\n5 days ago\nNo. Until now I haven't. It looks adapted indeed. I like the fact that they are sister properties such as ambiguous_for_taxon, dubious_for_taxon and never_in_taxon. I think we could use the two first one in some cases when documenting the presence of contaminants in a metabolite annotation process for example. This brings me to another question:  Would that be OK to use present_in_taxon for a molecule not biosynthesized by the organism. Could I say acetamiprid (an insecticide) is  present_in_taxon bee (Apis mellifera) ?</p>\n<p>ebi.ac.ukebi.ac.uk\nOntology Lookup Service (OLS)\nOLS is a repository for biomedical ontologies that aims to provide a single point of access to the latest ontology versions</p>\n<p>ebi.ac.ukebi.ac.uk\nOntology Lookup Service (OLS)\nOLS is a repository for biomedical ontologies that aims to provide a single point of access to the latest ontology versions</p>\n<p>ebi.ac.ukebi.ac.uk\nOntology Lookup Service (OLS)\nOLS is a repository for biomedical ontologies that aims to provide a single point of access to the latest ontology versions</p>\n<p>ebi.ac.ukebi.ac.uk\nOntology Lookup Service (OLS)\nOLS is a repository for biomedical ontologies that aims to provide a single point of access to the latest ontology versions</p>\n<p>wikidata.orgwikidata.org\n(E)-acetamiprid\nchemical compound</p>\n<p>Damion Dooley\n4 days ago\nYou would be doing that at the instance level?  A pesticide is not present in all bees.  Maybe in some bees belonging to a particular hive or area?  So not an “in taxon” relation but rather “part of” some organism or “part of” some organism which is member of some collection.  One can say an organism sample or part is “in taxon” some NCBITaxon entity.

It seems that the parent object property “taxonomic class assertion” definition “An assertion that holds between an ontology class and an organism taxon class, which is intepreted to yield some relationship between instances of the ontology class and the taxon.” dissuades us from using it for describing contaminants and “foreign objects”?\nI’m interested too in an answer to this modelling question, esp. for contaminants in food.  RO says “located in” is to be used as an instance level relation.  I recall “part of” has been used a lot too at instance level (rather than just to establish class relations). Hmm!

Yet, ‘part of’ doesn’t discern material that is normally part of the bee; wouldn’t it be informative to say something like ‘exogenous part of’; a relation that works for tooth fillings too etc. (There are ‘has host’ relations, but that’s not quite general enough).</p>\n<p>Chris Mungall\n3 days ago\nWhat’s the actual owl axiom?</p>\n<p>Damion Dooley\n5 hours ago\n<a title=\"Private\" href=\"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"private\">@Chris (Private)</a> Mungall\nI realize, related to your case 5, that to model a contaminant (rather than biosynthesized molecule) wrt an organism or material, we either need a kind of “X has part Y” relation that indicates the range is a contaminant relative to the domain entity; alternately I guess a “contaminant role” could be assigned between the part and the material, if that’s what you are getting at re. owl axiom. (Like Alotrope’s impurity role).</p>\n<p>Answering at</p>\n<p>Many thanks for all the very interesting comments !</p>\n<p>I see two different issues here (that maybe could be discussed in their own threads ?)</p>\n<p><em>Problem 1.</em> <em>Are we linking a molecule to a taxon or to an organism ?</em> The way we have done this for now (at least in the frame of LOTUS) is that we linked the molecule to the lowest taxonomical level (the most precise) of the organism in which it has been found. For example <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105674316\">trigocherrin A</a> <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P703\">found in taxon</a> <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3006048\">Trigonostemon cherrieri</a> <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P248\">stated in</a> <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83059010\">\"Trigocherrin A, the first natural chlorinated daphnane diterpene orthoester from Trigonostemon cherrieri\"</a> (available at <a href=\"https://sci-hub.se/10.1021/ol2030907\">https://sci-hub.se/10.1021/ol2030907</a>). In the original paper there is no information regarding the specific specimen of Trigonostemon cherrieri which was extracted, no geographical coordinate for example.</p>\n<p>Thus describing the link to the taxon and not the organism itself is the best we can do (with this type of information source in our hands). So my question is why should we precise <strong>some</strong> as proposed by <a title=\"Private\" href=\"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"private\">@Ray (Private)</a> ? erythromycin found in taxon <strong>some</strong> Aeromicrobium erythreum (here i replaced the part_of by found_in_taxon so as not to mix the two topics). If the statement is true for a specific organism (e.g. a precise strain of Aeromicrobium erythreum cultivated under given conditions) this still holds true for the taxon Aeromicrobium erythreum and higher taxa ranks (e.g. genus Aeromicrobium). Right ? We are not using <a href=\"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002504\">always_present_in_taxon</a> so why should we precise <em>some</em> ?</p>\n<p>This topic is very interesting for us because in a much greater fashion than genomics, metabolomics reflects the phenotype and is greatly influenced by environmental conditions. So if we take <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105674316\">trigocherrin A</a> <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P703\">found in taxon</a> <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3006048\">Trigonostemon cherrieri</a> this might be true for this specific tree grown in this part of the island at this period of the year, but will not hold true when the tree is older at another time of the year and in other environmental conditions.\nFor this researchers should better document the organism they are profiling / extracting (exploiting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_treatment\">taxonomic treatments</a> and possibly ids such as an iNaturalist observation id or other georeferenced specimen e.g. <a href=\"https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/438823777\">https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/438823777</a>). But this is another topic ...</p>\n<p><em>Problem 2.</em> <em>What is the nature of the molecule we are linking ?</em> Chris proposed </p>\n<ol>\n<li>biosynthesized by pathways encoded by genes in the organism</li>\n<li>by product or intermediate of a native pathway of the organism (or further metabolized)</li>\n<li>produced by a microbe that is part of the “natural microbiome” [whatever that is] of that organism</li>\n<li>is in the metabolome of some tissue sample taken from that organism (guessing this is what LOTUS is?)</li>\n<li>Otherwise detected (including Ray’s pesticide case)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But we could also very well have :</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>exogeneous compound modified by the host</li>\n</ol>\n<p>or why not</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>exogeneous compound metabolized by a consortium of species from the host microbiota (see <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5534341/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5534341/</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since it is virtually impossible to establish the source of the thousand of molecules characterized during an untargeted metabolomics experiments it would be interesting to find a way to express the following generic statement \"this molecule has been detected in an organism identified as belonging to this taxon\". We are not saying that they are no other taxon involved in the production of this molecule, nor that it could be a xenobiotic for example, we just can't precise it for the moment.</p>\n<p>So if i understand, the <a href=\"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002175\">present_in_taxon</a> initially proposed by Ray would not be OK or would it ? To me it looked very similar to <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P703\">found in taxon</a> and quite generic but I must admit I am starting to get lost.</p>\n<p>By the way my question initially came from the fact that I am trying to propose a nanopublication template documenting such links across molecules and organisms. See <a href=\"https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/explore?id=https%3A%2F%2Fw3id.org%2Fnp%2FRATGmPlZuuhgKAcqSICT4Qg_J9z5N9rVQbdGt4hJ7yMJM\">example</a> for now using  <a

Overview\n\nThe Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DBGI, www.dbgi.org) ambitions to explore innovative solutions for the collection, management and sharing of digital information acquired on living botanical collections. A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github. You can edit them by clicking on the \"Click here to edit this page on Github !\" link at the bottom of the page. See down there 👇\n\nIf you are willing to participate the the DBGI Dendron notes have a look at the [[welcome]] section to get you started !\n\n\n## What's new ?!\n\nThis web site might not necessarily seem to be change since the last time you came to visit.\n\nIf something moved recently you should be able to track this over there https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/dendron-dbgi/commits/main"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.84.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"hooks":{"onCreate":[{"id":"hello","pattern":"hello.*","type":"js"}]}},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"DBGI Dendron page","description":"Open Notebook Science in the DBGI"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Participate and click here to edit this page on Github !","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/dendron-dbgi"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"enableHierarchyDisplay":true,"assetsPrefix":"/dendron-dbgi","siteUrl":"https://digital-botanical-gardens-initiative.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"ga":{"tracking":"G-EPEXM5GLLG"},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
