Simple rules : no taxonomical focus, maximize the coverage. This would allow to benchmark the current DBGI collection, labelling protocols, \"real-life\" and as a kind of transition from DBGI to EMI. Also possibility to test other sampling process (insects traps and similar with Donat) Of course this would also be a great occasion to gather and enjoy the Valais spring. Wine will be STRICTLY FORBIDDEN, obviously (apart for sampling purpose ... you'll define your sampling approach)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Second part would be in the labs here. From Raw samples to a series of pertinent questions in the established Knowledge graph. Overview of the sample prep process, the metabolomics analysis, the data treatment, the enrichment process, the harmonization with external resource, graph creation and query.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This would allow all of us to have a clear overview + a hands on experience of the process ranging from the specimen collection in the field to the interrogation of its metabolome through SPARQL. It should allow us to benchmark all of the steps and see how things scale up and how the several tools can be used/misused/improved by the participants. We would also document as much as possible these days. This would be pushing the \"bio-blitz\" concept (<a href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/bioblitz+guide\">https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/bioblitz+guide</a>) a bit further than iNat observation or plain species monitoring. </p>\n<p>We would like to fully document the two stages of our experiment here and issue a publication type \"From the field to the graph: an open resource documenting the metabolome of XXX species established in XX days, by XX persons\". Furthermore we might have a skilled and professional cameraman (Christian in cc.) to document the whole process and produce a short movie !</p>\n<h2 id=\"organization\">Organization<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#organization\"></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"what-should-i-do-prior-to-the-event-\">What should I do prior to the event ?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#what-should-i-do-prior-to-the-event-\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Prepare my stuff (see <a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/notes/b7e4siv7m4n6bondte8ovob\">checklist</a>), and make sure to have all the necessary equipment for the field trip.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some software to fetch and account to create.

A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github. You can edit them by clicking on the \"Click here to edit this page on Github !\" link at the bottom of the page.
