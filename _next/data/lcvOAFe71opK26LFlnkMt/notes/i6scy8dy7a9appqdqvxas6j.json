Double tap on the bee logo, a new field called \"Server URL\" will appear. Fill it with \"<a href=\"https://emi-collection.unifr.ch%22\">https://emi-collection.unifr.ch\"</a> and enter you username and password you used to register on <a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/notes/6c0o64alpn9ytm0qaxdfa9a\">QFieldCloud</a>.</li>\n<li>Click Sign In.</li>\n<li>Once signed in, go to Community and click on your project.

Normally, if some modification are available on the cloud, you should have an exclamation mark inside the blue cloud:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>After opening the project, click on the blue cloud</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then hit Synchronize</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3) Add features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Select the layer you want to edit and pass in editing mode (<em>Figure 1</em>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optionnaly, you can activate the GPS location to locate you approximatively on the field.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you point the plant location, tap on the \"plus\" button. This will make appear a form that you can fill.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>4) Fields to fill:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>collector_fullname corresponds to your name. If you are not in the list, you can add yourself by filling the \"collector_list\" layer (same process as above). Check the box on the right to keep the selection between observations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>observation_subject corresponds to the organ/part of the specimen you want to collect. If you don't find a correct term, you can add it by filling the \"observation_subject\" layer. Check the box on the right to keep the selection between observations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>inat_upload is a tick button that allows you to choose whether your observation has to be uploaded on iNaturalist or not. This option is ticked by default. Example cases when this button has to be unticked: non-living samples (soil, water, ..) or multiple macroscopic species (20x20cm whole sampling for example). Check the box on the right to keep the selection between observations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>is_wild is a tick button that allows you to chooss whether the specimen you want to collect is wild or captive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>taxon_name field corresponds to the scientific name of the plant (open form where you can search on). If you are unsure or you don't know the species no worry, it's why we upload the observations on iNaturalist.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>no_name_on_list is a tick button you can tick if the specimen you are observing is not present on the taxon_name list. It will make appear a field called name_proposition where you can write free text to identify the specimen</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>sample_id is the code sticked on the tube. You can scan it by clicking on the 3 dots.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then you have 5 (+1 optional if needed) pictures to take of the species, one of the specimen label (if available), one in general, one of the plant's details (flowers or remarkable details that permit identification), one where you cut and one with the species label (if availabe) and the dbgi code on the tube.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The form contains two more tabs containing individual and environmental fields. These fields are optional. You can choose to fill them or not, following the results you want to obtain. You have free comments in these tabs, so if you want to add informations on the samples, you can add them here (\"comment_eco\" and \"comment_env\")</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once done, the upper of the form should be green, and you can add you observation to the project by clicking on the tick in the upper left corner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now you can collect the sample and put it in a tube.

These layers are made to observe specimens that can't be collected (vertebrates, protected species, ...). They will then be uploaded to iNaturalist and enter the database to possibly collect them during another collection process.</p>\n<p>6) Upload your features:</p>\n<p><strong>This system works offline, so each time you finish your collection, you need to update the project on the server.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click on the little cloud and click on \"push modifications\". </li>\n<li>Wait until all is synced.

A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github.
