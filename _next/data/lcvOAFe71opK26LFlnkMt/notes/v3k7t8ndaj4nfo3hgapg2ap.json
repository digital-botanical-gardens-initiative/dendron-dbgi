id=\"laboratory-application\">Laboratory Application<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#laboratory-application\"></a></h1>\n<p>The laboratory application is an android application coded using <a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/\">Kotlin</a> programming language with <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio?hl\">Android Studio</a> IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Android Studio permits to create and test the application on Android phones.</p>\n<p>The application can be downloaded <a href=\"https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/DBGI_tracking_android/releases\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This application is free and open source. The source code can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/DBGI_tracking_android\">there</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"connection\"><a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/notes/xvxsf3dxv17ajlxffib7pfy\">Connection</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#connection\"></a></h2>\n<p>The application will ask <a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/notes/ieyeybee3t9qu8mfy5lkpth\">Directus</a> credentials in order to have access to the database. If the connection is successful, it will redirect to the printer connection screen to choose if the user wants to connect a <a href=\"https://www.brady.eu/\">Brady</a> printer or not. For now, the compatible printers are <a href=\"https://www.bradyid.com/label-printers/portable/m211-portable-bluetooth-label-printer-pid-170380\">Brady M211</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bradyid.com/label-printers/portable/m511-portable-bluetooth-label-printer-pid-170969\">Brady M511</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"home-page\"><a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/notes/7taur6unqrnfxb1yxynycve\">Home-Page</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#home-page\"></a></h2>\n<p>The Home Page screen permits to choose which step in the laboratory you want to perform. Actually, six modes are available (<em>Figure 1</em>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Falcon Mode</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Weighting Mode</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Extraction Mode</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aliquots Mode</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Signaling Mode (available soon)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Find Mode (available soon)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"falcon-mode\"><a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/notes/yaxymakkq1g25x257rx1070\">Falcon-Mode</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#falcon-mode\"></a></h2>\n<p>The Falcon Mode permits to associate the field samples colleced in Falcon tubes to a 24 holes rack. The operation is made in two steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Scan the rack label you want to fill</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scan the samples you want to put inside</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The application will check if there is already samples in the rack and count the ones that are added. It permits to avoid attribution errors and doesn't let users attribute more samples than the rack can contain (<em>Figure 1</em>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"weighting-mode\"><a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/notes/pfdpnk3izpbyabgx9i9npko\">Weighting-Mode</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#weighting-mode\"></a></h2>\n<p>The Weighting Mode permits to collect metadata about the weighting process and also prints a label for the new sample created. The application will let the user choose the weight SI unit that suits the best to his need and the tolerance. The tolerance is here to avoid typing errors during the weight entry. The user can also choose to ignore weight constraint to have a completely free weighting cession.</p>\n<p>Once these options are set, the user will then have access to a QR reader to scan samples and attribute the weight. If a printer is connected, the label for the new sample will be automatically printed. This label is suffixed _tmp, as it is a transitional object that won't be kept after the extraction process (<em>Figure 1</em>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"extraction-mode\"><a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/notes/1yrhcmefwr4nn76nmz8r6c3\">Extraction-Mode</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#extraction-mode\"></a></h2>\n<p>The extraction Mode permits to collect metadata about the extraction process and also prints a label for the extract vial. The user has the option to generate a new batch ID, that permits to track the solvent quality. If thi button is pressed, two labels will be printed, one for the solvent batch, in order to link it with the samples extracted with this solvent, and the other one to create a blank of this solvent in order to track the quality. Then the user can choose the extraction method and enter the solvent volume he will add to the sample. Then he will have to scan a vial box in order to associate the newly created solvents to this box. There is the same check as with Falcon rack to avoid attribution errors.</p>\n<p>Once thes options are set, the user will then have access to a QR reader to scan weighted samples and create the extract label, that is the same as in the Weighting mode but without _tmp suffix, as the extract will enter in the extract collection (<em>Figure 1</em>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"aliquots-mode\"><a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/notes/32zr0dn70q23a2j2y2ymt35\">Aliquots-Mode</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#aliquots-mode\"></a></h2>\n<p>The aliquot mode permits to collect metadata about the aliquot process and also prints a label for the aliquot vial. The user has to enter the volume he wants to prelevate and scan a vial box.</p>\n<p>Once thes options are set, the user will then have access to a QR reader to scan extracts and create the aliquot label (<em>Figure 1</em>).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/dendron-dbgi/assets/images_bruelhed/laboratory_app_workflow.svg\" alt=\"lab-app-workflow\"><em>Figure 1: Laboratory application workflow</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"signaling-mode\"><a href=\"/dendron-dbgi/notes/irja9akhmvo1ryicbyuhm7v\">Signaling-Mode</a><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#signaling-mode\"></a></h2>\n<p>This mode is for now a state-in-progress.

A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github. You can edit them by clicking on the \"Click here to edit this page on Github !\" link at the bottom of the page. See down there 👇\n\nIf you are willing to participate the the DBGI Dendron notes have a look at the [[welcome]] section to get you started !\n\n\n## What's new ?!\n\nThis web site might not necessarily seem to be change since the last time you came to visit.\n\nIf something moved recently you should be able to track this over there https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/dendron-dbgi/commits/main"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"dendronVersion":"0.84.0","enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"hooks":{"onCreate":[{"id":"hello","pattern":"hello.*","type":"js"}]}},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"DBGI Dendron page","description":"Open Notebook Science in the DBGI"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Participate and click here to edit this page on Github !","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/dendron-dbgi"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"enableHierarchyDisplay":true,"assetsPrefix":"/dendron-dbgi","siteUrl":"https://digital-botanical-gardens-initiative.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"ga":{"tracking":"G-EPEXM5GLLG"},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
