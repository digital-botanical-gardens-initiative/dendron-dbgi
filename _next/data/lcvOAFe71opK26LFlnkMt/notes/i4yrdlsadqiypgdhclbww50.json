ChatGPT help</p>\n<p>Certainly! Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns. The main idea with normalization is to divide a database into parts to minimize redundant data, ensure data dependencies make sense, and simplify the schema to make it more robust against anomalies when inserting, updating, or deleting data. The process is typically broken down into several \"normal forms\" (NF). Achieving third normal form (3NF) is often considered sufficient for most applications, ensuring a good balance between database performance and complexity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"first-normal-form-1nf\">First Normal Form (1NF)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#first-normal-form-1nf\"></a></h3>\n<p>For a table to be in the First Normal Form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It should have a primary key: A unique identifier for each row in the table.</li>\n<li>The values in each column of the table should be atomic (no multi-value attributes or repeating groups).</li>\n<li>The entries in any column must be of the same data type.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"second-normal-form-2nf\">Second Normal Form (2NF)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#second-normal-form-2nf\"></a></h3>\n<p>To achieve the Second Normal Form, a table must first be in 1NF and then:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All non-key attributes must be fully functional and dependent on the primary key.

For 2NF, we ensure all attributes in each table are fully dependent on the primary key. If there were a table where part of the primary key (in case of composite keys) did not determine some of the attributes, we would need to adjust, but our current design avoids this issue.</p>\n<p><strong>3NF Adjustments:</strong></p>\n<p>To move to 3NF, check for transitive dependencies, where a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute. Suppose in our Organizations table, we had \"OrganizationType\" and \"OrganizationAddress,\" and suppose \"OrganizationType\" could determine \"OrganizationAddress\" (a bit contrived, but useful for illustration). In that case, we might move \"OrganizationAddress\" to a separate table where \"OrganizationType\" is the key, ensuring every non-key attribute only depends on the primary key.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion-and-application\">Conclusion and Application<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#conclusion-and-application\"></a></h3>\n<p>Normalization, up to 3NF, helps in designing a database that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimizes redundancy</li>\n<li>Avoids update anomalies</li>\n<li>Ensures data integrity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By applying these principles to your database for the Earth Metabolome Initiative, you can design a schema that is efficient, scalable, and robust. Each entityâ€”Samples, Containers, Locations, and Organizationsâ€”should be designed to adhere to these normal forms. This approach helps in managing complex data relationships and ensures the database remains flexible and efficient as the project evolves.</p>\n<p>Let's illustrate the normalization process using a simplified example related to the Earth Metabolome Initiative, showing how a table evolves through the First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), and Third Normal Form (3NF).</p>\n<h3 id=\"initial-unnormalized-table\">Initial Unnormalized Table<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#initial-unnormalized-table\"></a></h3>\n<p>Imagine we start with a table that combines sample data, container information, location details, and organization info all in one:</p>\n<p><strong>Unnormalized Samples Table</strong></p>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>SampleID</th><th>SampleName</th><th>CollectionDate</th><th>ContainerType</th><th>LocationName</th><th>Latitude</th><th>Longitude</th><th>OrganizationName</th><th>OrganizationType</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>WaterSample1</td><td>2024-01-01</td><td>Tube</td><td>Amazon Basin</td><td>-3.4653</td><td>-62.2159</td><td>OrgA</td><td>Research Institute</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>SoilSample1</td><td>2024-02-01</td><td>Box</td><td>Sahara Desert</td><td>23.4162</td><td>25.6628</td><td>OrgB</td><td>University</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3 id=\"first-normal-form-1nf-1\">First Normal Form (1NF)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#first-normal-form-1nf-1\"></a></h3>\n<p>To convert to 1NF, we ensure the table has a primary key, and all attributes are atomic (no repeating groups or arrays).</p>\n<p><strong>Samples Table (1NF)</strong></p>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>SampleID</th><th>SampleName</th><th>CollectionDate</th><th>ContainerID</th><th>LocationID</th><th>OrganizationID</th></tr></thead></table></div>\n<p><strong>Containers Table (1NF)</strong></p>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>ContainerID</th><th>ContainerType</th></tr></thead></table></div>\n<p><strong>Locations Table (1NF)</strong></p>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>LocationID</th><th>LocationName</th><th>Latitude</th><th>Longitude</th></tr></thead></table></div>\n<p><strong>Organizations Table (1NF)</strong></p>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>OrganizationID</th><th>OrganizationName</th><th>OrganizationType</th></tr></thead></table></div>\n<h3 id=\"second-normal-form-2nf-1\">Second Normal Form (2NF)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#second-normal-form-2nf-1\"></a></h3>\n<p>For 2NF, we ensure that all non-key attributes are fully functional and dependent on the primary key.

A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not.
