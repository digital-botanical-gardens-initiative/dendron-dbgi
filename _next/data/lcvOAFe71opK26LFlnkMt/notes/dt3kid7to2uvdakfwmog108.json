In most metabolomics projects a heavy focus is drawn on the handling of data post-acquisition and much less on the tracking and documentation of the samples identity. However, this step is crucial within the DBGI and has one clear objective: make the bridge from physical (living biological organisms) to digital objects (metadata and chemical information) throughout the project. To this end, we will start by developing best practices for accurate digital description of physical objects as well as measurement protocols, in addition to the collected data. The practices will follow established ORD and FAIR principles, relying on relevant existing community vocabularies and ontologies or developing new ones when required. Next, we will provide a reference implementation of these generic ORD practices in the open-source Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) and Laboratory Information System (LIMS) openBIS [18], which is developed and maintained by the Scientific IT Services of ETH Zurich (co-applicant). While multiple commercial and online ELN-LIMS solutions exist, we do not consider them here as they do not follow Open Science principles, such as open-source or avoidance of vendor lock-in. We will thus implement the large possibilities offered by openBIS, which was designed as a modular, open-source and FAIR-compliant ELN and data management solution. openBIS is already in use at a large number of research labs at ETH Zurich, other institutions in Switzerland and abroad, including for several metabolomics and proteomics applications. Furthermore, openBIS already provides a connection to data repositories, such as Zenodo, which enables easy publication of data and metadata stored in openBIS. We will specifically i) evaluate openBIS capacities to track physical data located in several laboratories ii) evaluate openBIS installation as a lightweight and standalone sample tracking system implemented in partners lab and connected to a central DBGI openBIS server iii) evaluate the capacity of openBIS to feed graph type databases. Alternatively, a lightweight system constituted by a PostgreSQL DB running under a NocoDB GUI will be evaluated. Both approaches should provide in the end a user-friendly web-based interface for convenient tracking of samples by the DGBI participants. This will be the objective of WP2 - Sample tracking system establishment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"objectives\">Objectives<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#objectives\"></a></h3>\n<p>Establish a sound and robust sample tracking system connecting physical and digital objects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description-of-the-tasks-and-roles-of-the-partners-for-each-of-them\">Description of the tasks and roles of the partners for each of them<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#description-of-the-tasks-and-roles-of-the-partners-for-each-of-them\"></a></h3>\n<p>Best practices for sample tracking based on ORD and FAIR principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will develop best practices for the accurate description of samples, protocols and the associated data. To this end, we will rely on existing community standards, vocabularies or ontologies or develop new ones, if required.</li>\n<li>Since multiple existing databases and ontologies will be connected to the DBGI hub, it will be essential to properly define identifiers. For this we will take advantage of the Bioregistry (<a href=\"https://bioregistry.io/\">https://bioregistry.io/</a>) as a meta-registry and an identifier resolver.</li>\n<li>For data, we will investigate both Frictionless Standards (<a href=\"https://frictionlessdata.io/standards/\">https://frictionlessdata.io/standards/</a>) to describe data and data types used in the projects in an optimal manner and several options offered by the Frictionless Software toolkit (<a href=\"https://frictionlessdata.io/\">https://frictionlessdata.io/</a>).</li>\n<li>This work will result in a set of ORD practices, recommendations and principles that are open and reusable and therefore immediately useful for the wider community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Implementation in openBIS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will provide a reference implementation of the generic ORD practices in the open and widely used ELN-LIMS system openBIS. openBIS consists of three different parts: an inventory, an ELN and a data management system.</li>\n<li>Samples and measurement protocols will be described in the inventory, together with associated metadata.</li>\n<li>Measurement data (e.g. from mass spectrometry) will be ingested in the data management system using automated scripts, which also handle the annotation with appropriate metadata. </li>\n<li>In addition to the standard, web-based openBIS user interface, we will also explore the development of a lightweight interface for phone / tablets, which will be used for tracking of samples by the DBGI participants.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further reference implementations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Depending on the adoption of the openBIS implementation for sample tracking by the community, we will also consider further reference implementations for sample tracking, using alternative database systems.

A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github.
