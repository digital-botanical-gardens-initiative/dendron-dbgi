So, I decided to use databricks community edition to run simple workflows which require upto 15GB RAM (<a href=\"https://community.cloud.databricks.com/\">https://community.cloud.databricks.com/</a>).

We did some brainstorming around how best to proceed with the AGORA project. Important points discussed:\na) Two main ideas: Make a video of informal interviews with researchers and PI who are deeply involved in this project, Design a SciComm project around data literacy (a topic rarely touched upon while comunicating with general public from non-Science background)\nb) Combination of both digital and physical components. e.g: A screen-panel with virtual safaris, where people can click a location on a word map and see what plants exist where, maybe try to convert this into a game with a reward.\nNote: Idea not discussed with Manuela: Virtual exhibition using <a href=\"https://v21artspace.com/virtual-exhibitions\">https://v21artspace.com/virtual-exhibitions</a> or <a href=\"https://www.artsteps.com/\">https://www.artsteps.com/</a>\nc) Fund-raising and SciComm are different projects. Try not to mix them.\nd) Apply for the big grant with a deadline in Sept rather than the rolling call. Set aside salary % (upto 40%) for Science communication expert.\ne) Check eligibility to appy for AGORA : citizenship criteria, research employment criteria (if I can show an employment contract with salary covered for the period of the employment, I can apply for AGORA individually, otherwise I can ask Emmanuel to apply).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I talked to Emmanuel about this and we discussed the following:\na) He will contact directors of botanical garden in Neuchatel  if they would like to have a panel with virtual components.\nb) Making a video is a good idea. I will contact a professional to help us with that.\nc) Data literacy sounds great, but the implementation is tricky and needs efforts. </p>\n<h2 id=\"notes\">Notes<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#notes\"></a></h2>\n<h2 id=\"todo-tomorrow-or-soon\">Todo tomorrow or soon<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#todo-tomorrow-or-soon\"></a></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a title=\"Private\" href=\"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"private\">#SciComm (Private)</a> Philipp gave contacts for people who can help with making videos. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>From Philip:</p>\n<p>Daniel Saraga:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.saraga.ch/\">https://www.saraga.ch/</a></p>\n<p>Mirko Bischofberger (also a film maker):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.science-studios.ch/\">https://www.science-studios.ch/</a></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><a title=\"Private\" href=\"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"private\">#VKG (Private)</a> Put the new ontologies to the github account.

A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient [biodiversity conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. \n\n# Main goals\n\nThe DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-13-23.png){max-width: 400px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\n# An Open Science project\n\n\n## Working with the workshop doors open\n\n![](/assets/images/2022-06-18-17-47-56.png){max-width: 400px}\n\nA way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. \n\n\n## Open Notebook Science\n\nIf we apply this \"working with the workshop doors open\" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of Open Science. These is more precisely the principle of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science\n\nFor the projects of the DBGI we will follow such an Open Notebook Science approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. \n\nYou can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].\n\nExpect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !\n\nEach pages of this website are written in markdown and hosted on Github.
